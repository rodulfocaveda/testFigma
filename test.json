    "body": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined the Biden administration's strategy towards China, seeking to refocus attention on what he called \"the most serious long-term challenge to the international order.\" In a lengthy speech delivered at George Washington University Thursday, the top US diplomat outlined the administration's approach as \"invest, align, compete,\" and said that although the United States does not seek conflict with China, it is prepared to defend its interests. \"We will invest in the foundations of our strength at home -- our competitiveness, our innovation, our democracy. We will align our efforts with our network of allies and partners, acting with common purpose and in common cause. And harnessing these two key assets, we'll compete with China to defend our interests and build our vision for the future,\" said Blinken. The speech comes as much of the focus of the United States -- and the global community -- has been turned to Russia's war in Ukraine.  Blinken highlighted \"Beijing's defense of President Putin's war to erase Ukraine's sovereignty and secure a sphere of influence in Europe,\" saying it \"should raise alarm bells for all of us, who call the Indo-Pacific region home,\" and more broadly emphasized the importance of focusing on the threats he said the Chinese government poses to the world, even as the war in Ukraine wages on. \"China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it,\" Blinken said. Blinken's roughly 40-minute long speech sought to underscore the degree to which the Washington-Beijing relationship is \"one of the most complex and consequential relationships of any that we have in the world today.\"  As he broadly described how the US intends to approach that relationship, he drew sharp distinctions between the two nations, describing things like China's \"repressive\" government, unfair trade practices and human rights abuses. However, the top US diplomat also repeatedly stressed that the US does not seek to stymy China as a world power or change its political system, nor does it seek a clash with it. \"We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. To the contrary, we're determined to avoid both,\" Blinken said.  He said the US is ready to strengthen diplomacy and increase communication with China \"across a full range of issues,\" and is prepared to work together on matters of mutual interest like climate change and Covid-19, noting that \"even as we invest, align and compete, or together with Beijing, where our interests come together.\" \"We can't let the disagreements that divide us stop us from moving forward on the priorities that demand that we work together for the good of our people and for the good of the world,\" he said. Blinken noted that \"this is a charged moment for the world.\" \"And at times like these, diplomacy is vital,\" the top US diplomat said. \"It's how we make clear our profound concerns, better understand each other's perspective, and have no doubt about each other's intentions.\" \"We stand ready to increase our direct communication with Beijing across a full range of issues. And we hope that can happen,\" he continued. New State Department China team As a means to try to foster that diplomacy, Blinken said he was determined to give the State Department the necessary tools, including \"building a 'China House,' a department-wide integrated team that will coordinate and implement our policy across issues and regions, working with Congress as needed.\" \"We remain committed to intense diplomacy, alongside intense competition,\" he said. However, Blinken also warned, \"we can't rely on Beijing to change its trajectory. So we will shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open and inclusive international system.\" \"We don't seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China -- or any country for that matter -- from growing their economy or advancing the interests of their people. But we will defend and strengthen the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations, and make it possible for all countries -- including the United States and China -- to coexist and cooperate,\" Blinken said.   On Taiwan, the top US diplomat again stressed that US policy towards the island over which China claims sovereignty has not changed, despite comments by President Joe Biden last week that the US would respond militarily if Beijing attacked Taiwan. \"We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We do not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means,\" Blinken said. However, Blinken noted that \"while our policy has not changed, what has changed is Beijing's growing coercion, like trying to cut off Taiwan's relations with countries around the world and blocking it from participating in international organizations, and Beijing is engaged in increasingly provocative rhetoric and activity, like flying PLA aircraft near Taiwan on an almost daily basis.\" \"These words and actions are deeply destabilizing. They risk miscalculation and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. As we saw from the President's discussions with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, maintaining peace and stability across the street is not just a US interest, it is a matter of international concern, critical to regional and global security and prosperity.\" The top US diplomat also emphasized the importance of ensuring that even as tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, ire is not focused the people of China or those of Chinese descent in the US. \"We also know from our history that when we're managing a challenging relationship with another government, people from that country or with that heritage can be made to feel that they don't belong here, or that they're our adversaries. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said. \"Mistreating someone of Chinese descent goes against everything we stand for as a country,\" Blinken continued, noting that the \"differences are between governments and systems, not between our people.\"",

    "body": "The economy is close to entering a recession, perhaps as soon as this year. To avoid taking too much of a financial hit, Americans will need to prepare.  Last summer, we wrote that US economic growth was already starting to slow and the economy would keep decelerating in the coming months. That is already proving to be true, with year-over-year GDP growth declining from 12.2% in the second quarter of 2021 to 3.5% in the first quarter of this year. The Commerce Department commonly cites GDP growth as the annualized percentage change from one quarter to another, but those numbers tend to gyrate much more than the year-over-year figures. Nevertheless, both data points show the slowdown in economic growth between 2021 and 2022.  And there is a toxic brew of external economic headwinds, including the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China, resulting in supply shocks that boost inflation and slow growth.  A key part of the inflation problem is linked to the massive $3.9 trillion in fiscal stimulus injected into the economy in 2020 and 2021, alongside well over a hundred billion dollars in bonds the Federal Reserve was buying each month since the height of the pandemic.  Of course, when economic slowdowns take hold, it makes sense for the Fed to try and shore up economic growth by cutting interest rates. But in this case, the Fed is trying to make up for failing to react to inflation sooner. We warned last year that inflation was getting out of hand. The central bank should have taken action last summer.   Now the Fed has little choice but to tighten policy by aggressively cutting rates to curb inflation. That materially increases the risk of pushing the economy into a full-blown recession.  It was only six months ago that the Fed began slowing its asset purchases. And it finally started rate hikes just two months ago, but at that point overall inflation had already shot up to a 40-year high, impacting Americans in every corner of the country.  For the average investor, it's hard to find a place to hide. Recessions are usually accompanied by outright bear markets, with stocks falling by well over 20%, and often by much more. And with the Fed now hiking rates aggressively, the bond market is no safe haven. Equities and bonds are riskier than usual, and surging inflation means that even cash under the mattress is losing its purchasing power.  What can Americans do? One answer may be to do nothing, and just try and ride out the volatility without trying to time the market. For those willing to lock up some money for at least a year, inflation-protected Treasury bonds could be part of the mix.  Consumers might consider cutting back on non-essential spending, especially avoiding splurging on big-ticket items. With recession storm clouds looming, it is a good idea to sock some money away for a rainy day.  And for job seekers, because recessions lead to major job losses, now is the time to update the resume and make any career moves while the job market is still hot. Keep in mind: The relatively secure jobs are with companies whose products or services customers need day in and day out — even during a recession — making such firms less vulnerable to the economy's troubles.  There will be more difficult economic news to come. And prudence calls for skepticism about any soothing words from the Fed, the Biden administration or Wall Street bulls about a hoped-for soft landing. But preparing ahead of time can help soften the blow. Having missed the opportunity to raise rates last year, the Fed is now risking recession in order to tame inflation. As a result, realistically and objectively, it's time to be on guard. ",

    "body": "A ransomware attack has forced officials in a 345,000-person New Jersey county to switch off their computers and set up temporary Gmail accounts so the public can email key agencies such as the health, emergency and sheriff's departments.  The hacking incident in central New Jersey's Somerset County, which began Tuesday, has disrupted services that rely on the county's databases, including accessing land and probate records, the county said in a statement. The ransomware attack has only affected email and IT systems; phone lines and emergency service systems are all working properly, the county said.  The hack also affected a web form through which residents can request replacement mail-in ballots for New Jersey's primary election next month. Residents can still call to request a replacement ballot or do so in-person, Nathan Rudy, Somerset County's director of public information, told CNN.  Rudy said it would be \"at least until the end of the week\" before the county's digital infrastructure would be fully functional after the hack.  It was unclear who was responsible for the hack. Rudy said the FBI was investigating the incident. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. The Somerset County hack is only the latest ransomware incident to hamper local government services in the US, which often struggle with resources to counter hacks. It marks the 22nd US state or local government to be hit by ransomware in 2022, according to Allan Liska, senior intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future In his first year in office, President Joe Biden exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in cybercriminals operating from Russian soil, some of whom had allegedly conducted high-profile hacks of US critical infrastructure.  While Russian authorities in January detained someone that US officials believe was responsible for the 2021 ransomware attack on US fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline, any bilateral progress on the issue appears to have stalled after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  With many alleged ransomware operatives living in Ukraine and Russia, the jury is still out on how the war in Ukraine has affected the ransomware ecosystem. Senior National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said Wednesday that there had been a decline in ransomware attacks against US organizations since the war began. But gathering authoritative data on ransomware attacks is difficult, as many victims do not report hacks. And US officials and private analysts have warned that the threat of ransomware will remain.

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi held a telephone call on Thursday and discussed the situation in Ukraine and the issue of global food security, according to readouts of the call from both the governments.  The Italian readout released following the call said the discussion between the two leaders focused on the situation in Ukraine and "efforts to find a shared solution to the ongoing food crisis and its serious repercussions on the poorest countries in the world."  The Kremlin in its readout said that Putin emphasized that Moscow is ready to make a "significant contribution" to avoid the food crisis through the export of grain and fertilizers, if the West lifts "politically motivated restrictions" on Russia.  "Noting the groundlessness of accusations with the supply of agricultural products to world markets, Vladimir Putin drew attention to the fact that the difficulties that have arisen are related, among other things, to disruptions in the operation of production and logistics chains, as well as the financial policy of Western countries during the coronavirus pandemic. The situation was aggravated due to anti-Russian restrictions imposed by the United States and the European Union," the Kremlin statement said.  Putin also informed Draghi about the "ongoing work to establish a peaceful life in the liberated cities of Donbas," the Kremlin said, adding the Russian leader also gave "fundamental assessments of the negotiation process frozen by Kyiv.\" "When discussing energy security issues, the intention of the Russian side to continue to ensure uninterrupted supplies of natural gas to Italy at prices fixed in contracts was confirmed," it said.  Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin visited Kyiv — as well as the cities of Irpin and Bucha — Thursday and meet with local residents and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.  She announced plans for additional support for Ukraine, including an increase in arms deliveries. After hearing testimonies about alleged atrocities committed by Russian soldiers, Marin emphasized that Finland supports Ukraine and the International Criminal Court bringing the perpetrators to justice, according to a Finnish government statement, and that there will be "no room for impunity.\" During the visit, Marin strongly condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, calling them \"a blatant violation of the UN Charter and international law,\" the statement said. "It is important for the European Union to be united, bold and determined in the face of Russia's invasion," Marin stressed, adding that "it is important to create concrete steps for Ukraine to become an EU Member State.\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions from the West have sent oil prices skyrocketing, lifting gasoline and diesel prices in the United States to unprecedented levels. Natural gas prices also have climbed around the world. After the West imposed tough penalties on Russia, Putin warned that "unfriendly" nationswould need to pay for crucial Russian shipments of natural gas in rubles instead of euros. Following payment disputes, Russia has turned off the flow gas to Finland, Bulgaria and Poland. "I wouldn't trust them," US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN in response to a question about whether Russia will ever again be considered a reliable energy supplier. "They have to prove they are a reliable partner and they're certainly not doing that." "They are weaponizing energy, which is another reason why as a nation, we should move to energy sources that cannot be weaponized," Granholm said while speaking from a General Electric wind turbine testing facility in New Orleans. Of course, Russia could argue that the West is also weaponizing energy. The United States and other countries have banned imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal, while Europe is debating similar steps.  Keep reading here. Brent crude oil climbed on Thursday to the highest level since late March, signaling more pain for drivers filling up at the gas pump. Brent, the world benchmark, jumped 2.8% to $117.25 a barrel in recent trading. Brent hit an intraday high of $117.39 a barrel, the highest since March 28.  Investors are watching nervously as European officials attempt to reach an agreement on phasing out Russian oil, a step that would further scramble energy flows.  "Oil prices keep grinding higher and it's tough to see how that doesn't continue if an oil embargo is put into place," said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at data and analytics firm Kpler. Oil prices remain significantly below the recent peak set in March during the initial shock after Russia invaded Ukraine. Brent topped out at $139.13 a barrel in early March, while US oil hit $130.50 a barrel.  "We have an orderly march higher, rather than some panic-induced price spike," Smith said.  Gas prices are at record highs, though they have begun to level out. The US national average for regular gasoline edged higher on Thursday to a fresh record of $4.60 a gallon, according to AAA. That's 30% more expensive than the day before Russia invaded Ukraine. Russian forces have lost "nearly about 1,000 tanks" and "well over 350 artillery pieces," as well as "almost three dozen fighter bomber fixed-wing aircraft and more than 50 helicopters" so far in the ongoing war in Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday. Still, with all of that loss, the US assesses that Russians "still have the … majority of their capability left to them," the official added. "They have invested an awful lot of their hardware and their personnel in this fight, and the Ukrainians have suffered losses, the Russians have suffered losses.\" "Russians do have a superiority here in terms of number of assets they can apply to this fight in terms of people, and equipment and weapons, and we just have to bear that in mind," the official added. There are now 110 operational Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside of Ukraine, which is an increase from 97 BTGs the US assessed were inside of Ukraine as of May 9, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday. That is an increase of about 13 BTGs in about two and a half weeks.  "The largest contingent remains in the south. But the western grouping, the central grouping and the eastern grouping each have roughly the same number of BTGs inside Ukraine," the official said. Russian forces have made "some incremental gains" in their push towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the official added, "not a lot but some incremental gains." Around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the US assesses that Ukrainians have "continued to push Russian forces further away\" in a range of "a few kilometers to more than 10 kilometers within the Russian border," the official said, "so no major change there." Meanwhile, 85 of the M-777 howitzers that the US has provided to Ukraine over the course of the last three military assistance packages are "forward," meaning they are being used on the frontlines of the war, the official told reporters Thursday.  Out of the 209,000 155 mm projectiles that were promised to Ukraine from the US, 190,000 of them have been transferred to Ukraine, the official added.  Nine of the 11 total Mi-17 helicopters the US promised to Ukraine have been transferred to Ukraine. The last two helicopters will arrive either "later this month or very early in June," the official said. US and NATO allies continue to train Ukrainian soldiers on US and NATO weapons systems outside of Ukraine, the official added. 419 Ukrainians soldiers have completed M-777 howitzer training, about 30 Ukrainians have completed the basic howitzer maintenance course, and another 17 have completed the more advanced 14-day maintainer course for the Howitzer systems, the official continued. About 20 Ukrainian soldiers are completing the second iteration of the training on the Phoenix Ghost Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, that the US provided to Ukraine, the official added.  The US is "also helping facilitate training" for Ukrainians on coastal defense missiles now that Denmark has agreed to contribute Harpoon launchers and vehicles to Ukraine, the official said. "Some training that needs to be done on how to use the Harpoon was not designed for coastal defense, it was designed for anti-ship warfare, ship-to-ship warfare, so this is a relatively new application of the missile, and therefore we know they're going to need a little bit of training on that," the official said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed peace proposals that would \"appease\" Russia in a speech Thursday to the parliament of Latvia.  \"There are people — and many of them among the powerful of this world — who believe that not all nations matter, who believe that a nation can simply be forgotten to try to keep peace,\" Zelensky said. \"Even the temporary peace, even the illusory one. Even peace at the cost of tens of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands deported, or millions deprived of their homeland. They are OK with that. Peace at the cost of the lives of others. But this should not be normal.\" Zelensky's remarks follow remarks from former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who appeared to suggest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that peace negotiations should be aimed at \"status quo ante\" boundaries that preceded the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 — in essence, conceding Crimea and parts of the Donbas to Russia. It also comes amid reports that Italy has concocted its own embryonic peace plan. \"Now we hear again that Russia should be given what it wants,\" Zelensky said. \"That supposedly it is necessary to accept that some nations may be deprived of part of their foreign policy rights, because certain — as they say — 'historical force' wants it. There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly 'appease' the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed — of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops.\"  In his remarks to the Latvian parliament, the Ukrainian president urged additional sanctions on Russia, particularly on its powerful energy sector exports.  \"It is necessary not only to finally agree on the sixth sanctions package against the Russian Federation, including the embargo on oil, oil blends and petroleum products,\" he said. \"But also prepare the seventh sanctions package, with even more powerful restrictions on Russia for terror against Ukraine. Just like Latvia, the whole of Europe must restrict Russia's energy weapons. Fully.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed China for defending Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, saying that defense "should raise alarm bells for all of us who call the Indo-Pacific region home." "Even while Russia was clearly mobilizing to invade Ukraine, President Xi and President Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was, and I quote, 'without limits,'" Blinken said in a speech on the Biden administration's policy towards China at George Washington University. He emphasized that the US is not seeking a conflict or a new Cold War with China. "Our task is to prove once again, that democracy can meet urgent challenges, create opportunity, advance human dignity, that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom and that all countries will be free to chart their own paths without coercion," said Blinken. "We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. To the contrary, we're determined to avoid both.\" \"Even as President Putin's war continues, we will remain focused on the most serious long-term challenge to the international order – and that's posed by the People's Republic of China," he added.  Grain shortages around the world caused by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine are "being felt on the African continent," the nominee to be the next top US general overseeing the US military presence in Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, told lawmakers Thursday. Cavoli, who currently serves as commander of US Army Europe-Africa, said he saw the impacts of the grain shortage on a recent trip to Kenya. "There was a significant impact there already. We know that in other countries such as Tunisia, the prices have skyrocketed for basic foodstuffs. So there is food insecurity in Africa that is being provoked by the shortage of grain," Cavoli said. While the shortage is being experienced in Africa, this will "largely be a European concern, because of the close connection between African security issues and European security issues," he added. Some countries, like Germany and Romania, are already starting to try to alleviate the problem, Cavoli said.  Romania has "made the port at Constanța available," Cavoli said, but that port will only allow "about 90,000 tons" of grain a day through, while there's about 22 million tons of grain backed up, he added. The German national railroad agency, Deutsche Bahn, also recently announced a new plan called the Berlin train lift to "dedicate trains to pulling wheat right out of Ukraine into western Europe," Cavoli said. "Poland has established a new border crossing regime with Germany to facilitate that. So I think some efforts are taking place, much more remains to be done, senator," he told lawmakers.  He also addressed the NATO bids of Finland and Sweden, saying they will bring "quite a lot of capability and capacity" to the alliance if they join. Cavoli is nominated to succeed the current US European Command Commander Gen. Tod Wolters. Russian forces are applying a wide array of weapons across several fronts in eastern Ukraine as they try to break down stubborn Ukrainian defenses, which are outnumbered and outgunned, according to Ukrainian officials. Several of those officials describe the situation as \"very difficult\" and admit Ukrainian units may have to fall back in some places. In recent days, Ukrainian officials say, the Russians have combined short-range ballistic missiles, multiple-launch rocket systems, heavy artillery and tanks in a remorseless bombardment of towns and cities in Luhansk and Donetsk regions still under Ukrainian control. The National Police of Ukraine said that civilians were killed in attacks on 13 settlements in Donetsk, with several towns not previously targeted suffering damage. Russian forces seem to be broadening the number of towns they are shelling as they try to destroy Ukrainian defenses and supply lines.  Their chief objective appears to be taking Sloviansk, which has seen an increase in shelling in recent days. Mayor Vadym Liakh said half the city is now without water, and there will be \"no gas supply until the heating season.\" A growing number of Ukrainian officials describe the military situation in dire terms, although Russian advances on the ground have been modest. Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of Ukraine's parliament who is on the National Security Committee, described the situation as \"difficult.\" He told Ukrainian television that \"the hottest spots are Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. The enemy is trying to encircle our troops.\"   The twin cities in Luhansk are almost entirely destroyed, but Ukrainian troops are still present. Nearly 15,000 civilians are estimated still to be in Severodonetsk. According to the Institute for the Study of War's latest battlefield assessment, \"Russian forces may need to conduct a ground offensive on Severodonetsk in upcoming days to maintain their pace after committing a significant portion of personnel, artillery, aviation, and logistics to the front.\" Venislavskyi said that if the Russians could break Ukrainian resistance there, \"their next targets are Bakhmut, Soledar,\" towns that are further west. In particular, regional officials say that the highway linking Bakhmut and Lysychansk — a resupply route for Ukrainian forces — is under constant attack. \"The enemy partially controls Lyman and goes to the outskirts of Severodonetsk. The situation in this operational area will be very difficult in the coming days,\" he said. He also suggested that additional Russian forces were being brought in, saying \"the enemy continues to accumulate reserves near Izium to attack Sloviansk and Barvinkove.\" \"The enemy is sending units from the Primorsky Krai, the Far East, and Siberia to Ukraine. Battalion groups are formed, loaded on the railway and sent to Ukraine,\" Venislavskyi said.  Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said the \"Armed Forces have been defending for the fourth month now. Our defensive positions are destroyed by the enemy every day.\" \"Luhansk region, the part that is under the control of Ukraine, is very small in terms of territory. Therefore, the Russians will try their best to take it. For them, this is the easiest way to win at least some intermediate victory. ... Our forces are gradually moving to more fortified positions,\" he said. Haidai is one of several Ukrainian officials to stress that the defenses in the east are vastly outnumbered.  \"You need to understand that a huge amount of equipment and people are fighting against us,\" he said. \"It takes time for [Western] weapons to reach us. They must pass from the west to the east of Ukraine. One or two howitzers will not change the position; we will simply lose them. Therefore, we need to wait and regroup,\" Haidai said.  He also acknowledged the probability that Ukrainian forces would have to fall back. \"Perhaps we will have to leave one more two settlements. But we need to win the war, not the battle,\" Haidai said. Rostyslav Smirnov, an adviser to the minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, told Ukrainian television that \"the advantage of the Russians in [terms of] personnel is eight to one,\" and the advantage in equipment more than twice that. Two captured Russian soldiers pleaded guilty in Kotelevsky court in Ukraine's Poltava region on Thursday to "violating laws and customs of war conducted with preliminary group conspiracy." Oleksandr Bobykin and Oleksandr Ivanov are accused of firing Grad rockets from Russia's Belgorod region towards Ukraine's Kharkiv region on Feb. 24. According to the case details made public on the court website, the men fired artillery and damaged "objects of civil and critical infrastructure, including private homes" in Kazacha Lopan and Veterynrne in the Kharkiv region. The soldiers were captured by Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv region, according to the court memos.  The court is due to deliver a verdict on May 31. At least four people have been killed and seven more wounded in shelling of regional centers in the Kharkiv area, according to Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the regional military administration.  In a message posted on his Telegram channel on Thursday, Syniehubov urged residents to stay in shelters during the ongoing exchanges of fire between Ukrainian and Russian forces. "The most intense fighting is happening in Izium region. The Russian forces are trying to improve their strategic positions in the Izium area and renew their offensive on Sloviansk," he said.  Syniehubov added that a number of other towns have been shelled in the last 24 hours, including Pyatyhatky, Balakliya, Tsyrkuny and the Chuhuyiv area. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO in a phone call on Thursday. According to a Élysée Palace readout of the call, Macron stressed to Erdogan \"the importance of respecting the sovereign choice of these two countries\" which he maintained was \"the result of a democratic process\" and \"a reaction to the evolution of their security environment.\" Erdogan has voiced his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance, claiming that their alleged sheltering of Kurdish \"terrorist organizations\" should bar them from entry.  The Turkish president told Macron that \"Sweden and Finland's contacts with individuals and so-called organizations under the control of the terrorist organization PKK/YPG would not be compatible with the spirit of alliance under NATO," according to the Turkish Directorate of Communications readout of the call.   The two leaders also addressed the food security crisis, focusing particularly on the \"urgent need to enable the export of Ukrainian grain,\" according to the Élysée.  \"They discussed the various possible ways to transport crops out of Ukraine, identified in conjunction with the United Nations, and agreed to remain in contact in order to find a solution quickly,\" the Élysée said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Eurasian Economic Union partners to choose "natural" partners and neighbors over other "well developed" economies on Thursday. Putin spoke via video link at the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) forum opening in Bishkek. He added there are more than 180 projects worth $300 billion on the EAEU forum agenda. EAEU is an economic union of post-Soviet economies initiated by Russia in 2015 to create a single market for Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It's impossible to \"switch off\" Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"imperialist\" aims, the German Chancellor said Thursday. In his closing speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Olaf Scholz said that the horrors in Ukraine cannot be ignored.  \"It keeps us up at night … will it expand beyond the borders of Ukraine?\" He said Putin will only seriously negotiate peace if his army can't break Ukrainian defensive forces, with neither Ukraine nor the European Union accepting peace dictated by Putin.  Scholz's comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky criticized Henry Kissinger's remarks after the former US Secretary of State appeared to suggest that Ukraine agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea. Zelensky on Wednesday compared Kissenger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938. Meanwhile, Scholz said that NATO \"will not become a party to this war,\" as that would put nuclear powers in opposition to each other. He added that Germany will welcome Sweden and Finland into NATO with \"open arms.\" Earlier, Scholz spoke of the war's impact on the international community, stressing \"we cannot let Putin win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it.\" He added that his country would be ready to defend itself at all times in light of Russia's actions. Russia plans to take the whole of Ukraine, with the capital of Kyiv being its main target, according to city mayor Vitali Klitschko. It is clear that Russia is not carrying out a \"special operation\" but rather a \"genocide\" in Ukraine, Klitschko said during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. He warned that Ukraine is not only defending its own sovereignty, but that of all like-minded nations.  \"We defend not just our families, we defend all of you,\" said Klitschko. \"We defend you because we have the same values.\" The war is a danger to Europe and the whole world, Klitschko said. He made a plea for \"fast decisions\" from other leaders on sending Ukraine more defensive weapons, which he says they need quickly. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has spoken out against Russia's \"bullying\" and \"atrocities\" in Ukraine during a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Thursday. Truss used an address to the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to speak out against Russian maneuvering in the Balkan nation, and urged partners to continue to rally behind Ukraine. \"As Russia meddles here, Putin's troops are committing atrocities just 700 miles away in Ukraine. The people of Ukraine need our support,\" said Truss. \"They need that support from the whole of Europe, from the whole of the free world. We need to back the people in their brave fight for their country,\" she added, urging allies not to compromise with or appease Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We have seen Russia's bullying tactics – just this week flagrantly saying they will let Ukrainian grain flow only if sanctions on them are lifted,\" said Truss. \"That is trying to hold the world to ransom, and it must not succeed. So now it is about digging deep, not backsliding,\" she added. \"Democracy and freedom must prevail over autocratic aggression,\" said Truss. \"Putin must lose in Ukraine. Putin's aggression must never succeed in Europe.\" Germany is working \"flat out\" to end its reliance on Russian gas imports, the country's Chancellor said Thursday, adding there was \"no doubt\" that both Berlin and the European Union would end their dependence on energy imports from Moscow. Russian oil could be completely phased out by the end of the year, Olaf Scholz added during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said Germany was looking towards liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and alternative sources of supply. The EU is following the \"same path,\" Scholz said. However, Ukraine is asking for maximum sanctions against Moscow, including an immediate ban on Russian oil and trade.  This restructuring will have an impact on EU economies, which is already being felt by a rise in energy prices, he warned.  Some background: Germany was one of Russia's largest importers of oil last year.  Before the Ukraine crisis, an $11 billion undersea pipeline -- Nord Stream 2 -- was being built to deliver gas from Russia to Germany.  In February, when Russia invaded, Germany halted its approval of the pipeline, leaving the 1,230-kilometer (764-mile) pipeline empty since its completion in September 2021. Russia says that \"illegal actions\" by the West are causing problems with grain supplies in Europe, after the Kremlin was accused of obstructing grain exports from Ukraine. \"We absolutely reject these accusations,\" presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists Thursday. \"On the contrary, we blame countries of the West for taking a number of illegal actions that have led to this 'blockade.'\" Asked whether this meant Western sanctions need to be lifted in order for grain supplies to resume, Peskov said: \"They must cancel those illegal decisions that prevent the charter of ships, the export of grain, etc.\" Earlier this week, the head of the UN World Food Programme called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to reopen blocked ports in Ukraine to prevent a global food crisis.  And European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has accused Putin of \"weaponizing\" food supplies in his invasion of Ukraine by confiscating grain supplies and machinery, as well as blocking exports from ports in the Black Sea. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, wheat supplies from Russia and Ukraine accounted for almost 30% of global trade.  Russian attacks on the key city of Severodonetsk continue Thursday, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that the war in Ukraine puts at risk the \"system of international cooperation that was forged after two world wars.\" Here's the latest on Russia's war in Ukraine: Massive Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine: On Wednesday alone Russian troops fired on 41 settlements in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, said Ukraine's Joint Forces Task Force in a statement Thursday. \"As a result of enemy shelling, 6 people were killed and 12 were injured,\" said the statement.\nBattle for Severodonetsk: Russian shelling of residential neighborhoods in the industrial city, which is key to controlling Luhansk, hasn't stopped for more than a week, Oleksandr Striuk, head of the Severodonetsk military administration, said in a radio interview Thursday. Russian forces have also been shelling a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, added Striuk.\nRussian attacks in Donetsk: Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" on the key town of Lyman in the neighboring Donetsk region. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control there, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the southeast of the town become more at risk of encirclement. Zelensky criticizes Kissinger: Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has made a blistering attack on Henry Kissinger, after the former US Secretary of State appeared to suggest that Ukraine should cede territory to Russia in peace negotiations. Zelensky compared Kissinger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938.\nScholz fires warning at Davos: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that Europe and the international community are at a critical point, and said the world has changed since the Ukraine war began. \"The world is at a turning point,\" said Scholz during a special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that not only is Ukraine at risk but also the \"system of international cooperation that was forged after two world wars.\"\nRussia cuts interest rates: A resurgent ruble — buoyed by robust oil and gas revenues — has taken some of the heat out of inflation and allowed Russia's Central Bank to cut interest rates. On Thursday, the bank announced that rates will fall from 14% to 11%, after inflation slowed to 17.5% in May compared to 17.8% in April. It is now forecasting that annual inflation will decrease to 5–7% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024. \nPortugal approves Chelsea sale: The Portuguese government has authorized the sale of Chelsea FC, the London football team owned by Roman Abramovich, a Russian businessman and Kremlin ally. An ownership group led by Todd Boehly looks set to take control of the club after the UK government and the English Premier League also approved the deal this week.\nFood crisis: Russia is trying to \"blackmail\" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukraine's foreign minister said. He warned that if Moscow does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a \"multi-year food crisis.\" ##Catch Up## Russian troops attacked more than 40 towns in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions Wednesday, according to Ukraine's Joint Forces Task Force, indicating the scale of a major Russian offensive in the Donbas region. \"During the day, on May 25, Russian troops fired on 41 settlements in Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" the statement on Facebook Thursday read. \"As a result of enemy shelling, 6 people were killed and 12 were injured.\" According to the statement, Russian fire destroyed or damaged 52 high-rise and private residential buildings and other civilian facilities, as well as railway lines and agricultural buildings.  Over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian rescuers had evacuated about 760 people from areas of active combat, the statement added. The Ukrainian cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk are under Russian assault amid an offensive in the eastern Luhansk region, the Office of the President of Ukraine said in an update Thursday.  Severodonetsk -- an industrial city situated across the Siverskyi Donets river from Lysychansk -- has been under heavy shelling, and the statement said the Impulse Research and Production Association and 11 high-rise buildings in the city had been destroyed. Oleksandr Striuk, head of the Severodonetsk military administration, said in a radio interview Thursday that the connection between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk had been \"complicated\" because of Russian shelling of a bridge between the two cities. The enemy hasn't stopped shelling residential neighborhoods for the past one-and-a-half weeks, Striuk said.  \"12,000 -- 13,000 people remain in the city. People are hiding in shelters and basements. The city is under constant fire.\" Striuk added that communication was limited and that 90% of Severodonetsk's housing stock had been damaged or destroyed. The fall of Severodonetsk -- the last major city in the Luhansk region under Ukrainian government control -- would be a major setback for Kyiv. \"The situation is difficult, especially in the Donetsk operational district,\" said Fedir Venislavskyi, a Ukrainian lawmaker and member of the parliamentary Committee for National Security, Defense and Intelligence.  \"The hottest spots are Severodonetsk and Lysychansk,\" he said, adding that Russian soldiers were trying to encircle Ukrainian troops before next targeting the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar.  \"The enemy partially controls Lyman and is going to the outskirts of Severodonetsk. The situation in this operational area will be very difficult in the coming days,\" Venislavskyi said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that Europe and the international community are at a critical point, and said the world has changed since the Ukraine war began. \"The world is at a turning point,\" said Scholz during a special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that, not only is Ukraine at risk, but also the \"system of international cooperation that was forged after two world wars.\" The war was a \"thunderbolt,\" but the prospect of Russia \"capturing Ukraine seems less likely than it did at the beginning\" of the invasion, said Scholz, citing the fierce resistance by Ukrainian troops and help from the international community. Moscow has failed in its military objectives so far, but succeeded in uniting the international community and fast forwarding Ukraine's plan to join the European Union, he added.  \"We cannot let Putin win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it,\" said Scholz. He added that Germany will equip its army so it's ready at \"all times\" to defend itself \"under the new conditions\" dictated by Russia. Germany is in the process of changing its constitution to make this happen, hoping to make more than $105 million available to modernize its armed forces, he added.  \"It is the security of our country that is at stake,\" he said. \"We are sending an unequivocal message to our allies that you can rely on Germany.\" Russia slashed interest rates on Thursday as a resurgent ruble — buoyed by robust oil and gas revenues — takes some of the heat out of inflation. The Russian Central Bank cut interest rates from 14% to 11%, after inflation slowed to 17.5% in May compared to 17.8% in April, said the bank, which is now forecasting that annual inflation will decrease to 5–7% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024.  The bank raised interest rates to 20% as the Russian economy was hit by Western sanctions, but the latest move means they are now almost the same as before the invasion of Ukraine, when they stood at 9.5%.  \"External conditions for the Russian economy are still challenging, considerably constraining economic activity,\" said the bank. \"Financial stability risks decreased somewhat, enabling a relaxation of some capital control measures.\" Reacting to the decision, William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that additional rate cuts and easing of capital controls seem likely. \"The key point is that high oil and gas revenues are providing policymakers with a lifeline, allowing them to row back emergency economic measures,\" said Jackson. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the economy was \"withstanding the impact of sanctions\" despite a gloomy outlook. \"Despite all the difficulties, the Russian economy is withstanding the impact of the sanctions, and withstanding it quite well,\" Putin said in a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.  \"Yes, it's not easy. Everything that happens requires special attention from the economic bloc of the government. On the whole, these efforts are having a positive effect,\" said Putin. Some background: In late April, Russia's Central Bank said the Russian economy was expected to shrink by 8-10% in 2022, noting a decline in economic activity in March after the imposition of international sanctions on Russia.  Earlier the same month, the World Bank predicted that Russian GDP would shrink by 11.2% in 2022.  Western sanctions imposed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine are making life difficult for the Kremlin, but they are also affecting the global economy. \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has compounded the Covid-19 pandemic – a crisis upon a crisis – devastating lives, dragging down growth and pushing up inflation,\" according to a blog from the International Monetary Fund published Monday. The United Nations' under secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs plans to visit Moscow in early June to discuss the situation in Ukraine, a spokesman for the Russian mission to the UN said Wednesday, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS.  Martin Griffiths plans to visit Moscow to \"continue dialogue he began during his previous visit to Moscow,\" and \"to discuss the entire spectrum of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine,\" spokesman Fyodor Strzhizhovsky said. Griffiths' previous visit to Moscow last month was an attempt to facilitate a \"humanitarian ceasefire,\" having been charged with meeting both parties in the conflict by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Strzhizhovsky added that the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Rebeca Grynspan will visit Moscow to discuss the export of Russian fertilizers. In recent months, the price of fertilizer -- an essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops -- has risen due to issues with exports from Russia. Output from Europe has also declined due to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. Norway's Yara -- one of the world's largest fertilizer makers -- has reduced export due to the surge in natural gas prices, cutting down the amount of ammonia and urea output from their plants in Italy and France. According to TASS, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said on Wednesday that the resolution of the food problem \"requires a comprehensive approach,\" calling for the lifting of sanctions on Russian exports and financial transactions. The Portuguese government has authorized the sale of Chelsea FC, the London football team owned by Roman Abramovich, a Russian businessman and Kremlin ally. Abramovich is subject to sanctions by the UK government and has seen his assets frozen. He put the club up for sale in early March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying at the time that it was \"in the best interest of the club.\" Abramovich has Portuguese citizenship and, due to sanctions, the government in Lisbon was required to approve the sale. \"Portuguese authorization is a result of the guarantee given by British authorities that proceeds from the sale will be used for humanitarian ends, without benefiting directly or indirectly the club owner, which is on the European Union sanctions list,\" the government said in a statement Wednesday evening. \"The national position has the assent of the European Union,\" the Portuguese executive added. The UK government has already permitted the sale, which will end Abramovich's almost two decades as owner of the club.  And on Tuesday the English Premier League announced that its board had approved the sale of the club. The deal, worth more than $5 billion, will see an ownership group led by Todd Boehly take control. Boehly has invested in a portfolio of sporting franchises, including stakes in the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks. \"Fierce battles\" are taking place around the strategically important city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. It comes as Russian forces intensify efforts to take full control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, parts of which have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.  Here's the latest on Russia's war in Ukraine: Battle for Severodonetsk: Russian shelling of the industrial city, which is key to controlling Luhansk, has increased \"exponentially,\" a top Ukrainian military official said Wednesday as Russian troops transfer from different regions to push through in the region \"at any cost.\" \"The next week is important,\" said Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk military administration. \"If they do not succeed by Saturday or Sunday, they will run out of steam, and the situation will at least stabilize for us.\"\nRussian attacks in Donetsk: Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" on the key town of Lyman in the neighboring Donetsk region. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control there, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the southeast of the town become more at risk of encirclement. Food crisis: Russia is trying to \"blackmail\" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukraine's foreign minister said. He warned that if Moscow does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a \"multi-year food crisis.\"\nPutin's sweeteners: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Wednesday with soldiers wounded in Ukraine during a rare visit to a military hospital, according to footage released by the Kremlin. It comes as he announced that state pensions and the minimum wage will rise substantially in Russia from June 1 amid rising inflation.\nPassports for separatists: Also on Wednesday, Putin signed a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions occupied by Russian troops to obtain Russian citizenship. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemned the move. \nEU oil ban talks: European Council chief Charles Michel is \"confident\" that any issues over a proposed ban on Russian oil imports will be resolved by the next council meeting on May 30. \"We are working very hard in order to be able to stay united,\" he said. \nRallying call: Britain's foreign secretary will travel to Bosnia on Thursday, where she will use an address to the country's armed forces to urge the UK's Western partners to ensure Putin loses in Ukraine and warn against appeasing the Russian leader. ##Catch Up## Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has made a blistering attack on former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who suggested on Tuesday that peace negotiations should be aimed at creating borders along the \"line of contact\" in Donbas as it existed on the eve of the Russian invasion. Kissinger was speaking by video link to the Davos Forum.   In a video message Wednesday, Zelensky said, \"No matter what the Russian state does, there is someone who says: 'let's take into account its interests.' This year in Davos, it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians being killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the 'filtration camps' built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt.\n\"Russia has done all this in Europe. But still, in Davos, for example, Mr. Kissinger emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia.\" In his remarks, Kissinger said of the conflict that: "Negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome. Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante," apparently suggesting that Ukraine agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea. \"Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself,\" Kissinger said. Zelensky compared Kissinger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938. \"It seems that Mr. Kissinger's calendar is not 2022 but 1938, and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos but in what was then Munich,\" he said. \"By the way, in the real year 1938, when Mr. Kissinger's family was fleeing Nazi Germany, he was 15 years old.\" Zelensky called those who advise that Ukraine give something to Russia, the \"'great geo-politicians,' do not always want to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they are proposing to exchange for the illusion of peace. You always have to see people.\" Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned a move by Moscow that makes it easier for Ukrainians in some Russian-occupied regions to obtain Russian citizenship. \"Illegal passportization in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in Crimea and the temporarily occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, is a gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, norms and principles of international humanitarian law, and the obligations of Russia as an occupying power in accordance with Article 45 of the 1907 Hague Convention and Article 47 of the 1949 Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,\" the ministry said in a statement. \n\"The decree of the president of Russia is legally null and void and will have no legal consequences. This decision will not affect the citizenship of Ukrainians on the territories temporarily occupied by Russia.\" Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday streamlining the process for providing passports to Ukrainians in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Russia has already handed out hundreds of thousands of passports to residents of separatist areas in Ukraine's east and in the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea, as well as to residents of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Transnistria in Moldova. Analysts say those moves have helped Moscow create a pretext for continued intervention in those areas.  Yevhen Yaroshenko, an analyst for the human rights organization Crimea SOS, said Russia's policy of \"passportization\" may also serve an agenda of providing conscripts for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   \"Shortly after obtaining a Russian passport, the Russian Federation may call up such a person for military service and subsequently involve him in combat operations against Ukraine,\" Yaroshenko said. \"Thus residents of the temporarily occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions become hostages of the call of the Russian Federation.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the launch of a new joint UK, EU and US group to help support efforts of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General (OPG) to document war crimes and other atrocities committed in Ukraine. The new mechanism, called the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), will "provide strategic advice and operational assistance to the War Crimes Units of the OPG, the legally constituted authority responsible for prosecuting war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,\" Blinken said.  \"Although the United States and our partners are supporting a range of international efforts to pursue accountability for atrocities, the OPG will play a crucial role in ensuring that those responsible for war crimes and other atrocities are held accountable.\"  He added the "ACA will liaise with the Department of Justice as it pursues accountability in US courts." In addition to streamlining efforts, the ACA will also provide expanded funding for the team of international prosecutors and other war crimes experts already deployed to the region, Blinken said. Earlier this week, a 21-year-old Russian soldier was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed man in Ukraine's first war crimes trial since Russia's invasion began. Russia is trying to "blackmail" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. This is \"clear blackmail,\" Kuleba claimed. \"You could not find a better example of blackmail in international relations.\"  He warned that if Russia does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a "multi-year food crisis." Some background: Before the war, Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest exporter of corn and fifth-largest exporter of wheat, according to the US State Department. Almost 30% of global trade in wheat came from Russia and Ukraine alone. Speaking at a panel discussion, Kuleba said Russia and Ukraine are nowhere near the possibility of negotiated peace and that Moscow has no intention of taking part in discussions aimed at ending the war.  "When you are conducting an operation like this, you basically say no to negotiations. If Russia had preferred talks to war, they would have behaved differently," he said.   Making concessions to Russia has not worked since 2014 and won't work now, Kuleba said.  "This strategy has been used by the leading global forces from 2014 to Feb. 24, 2022. Make concessions here, make concessions here, it will help prevent war. It has failed. Eight years of this strategy has resulted in missiles hitting Kyiv and bloodshed in Donbas,\" the foreign minister said.  Kuleba called again for further sanctions against Russia, namely stopping the purchase of Russian oil, which he said is keeping Moscow in a comfortable position. "Ukraine is suffering more than Russia is with the sanctions against it. ... After three months of war, my message is simple: kill Russian exports. Stop buying from Russia and allowing them to make money that they invest in the war machine to kill and destroy," he said.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has said that Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" in order to seize the key town of Lyman in the Donetsk region. Ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian efforts to \"completely take control\" of Lyman \"did not succeed.\" However, images posted on social media Wednesday showed Russian soldiers at identifiable locations in northern neighborhoods of the town, which Ukrainian forces have defended in the face of an intense assault since late April. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control over the town, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the southeast of Lyman become more at risk of encirclement. Motuzyanyk added, \"The enemy is conducting offensive operations, trying to surround our units near Lysychansk and Severodonetsk and reach the administrative border of Luhansk region.\" On Tuesday, the head of the regional administration in Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, described the situation in Lyman as \"very difficult.\" \"It's now under constant fire,\" he said. \"The enemy entered the territory of the Lyman community a long time ago. Their main goal is to take the center of the community of Lyman. The estuary is now partially under control, they enter, then they are kicked out, heavy artillery drives in, and tanks enter the outskirts of the city to conduct shelling and occupy the entire center and the entire Lyman community.\" The Institute for the Study of War reported in its latest assessment Tuesday that Russian forces continued to \"prioritize attacks against Lyman rather than Slovyansk on May 24, likely to support a shallow encirclement of Ukrainian troops northwest of Severodonetsk.\" European Council chief Charles Michel is \"confident\" that any issues over a proposed ban on Russian oil imports will be resolved by the next council meeting on May 30.  Addressing a news conference alongside Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm on Wednesday, Michel said that although he was \"still confident\" the bloc will be able to resolve any issues, it will require \"a lot of dialogue.\"  \"We are working very hard in order to be able to stay united,\" Michel stressed.  The Swedish prime minister publicly declared the country's desire \"to go further\" with sanctions against Russia.  The proposed ban has been largely opposed by Hungary, which has said that such a measure would be \"against Hungarian national energy security.\" "

    "body": "When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by video to a packed room at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he thanked the West for its solidarity against Russia. But he also issued a warning to political leaders and business executives: Don't lose your nerve.  \"I would only wish you not lose this feeling of unity,\" he said, calling again for maximum pressure on Moscow. Three months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leaders from Europe and the United States emphasize that they remain committed to sticking with unprecedented sanctions in an attempt to force President Vladimir Putin to pull its troops out.  But as the cost of food and fuel jumps — fanning political protests and public discontent around the world, and increasing the risk of a recession — maintaining a consensus could prove increasingly challenging. \"I am very worried about what a recession in Europe would do to European resolve to stick with it and continue to escalate the sanctions,\" Jason Furman, a Harvard professor who previously served as President Barack Obama's top economic adviser, told CNN Business. Already, cracks are starting to form in Europe's united front. Hungary's Viktor Orban, who was not present in Davos, has led dissenters in blocking the European Union's plans for an oil embargo on Russia, a bid to cut off a major source of revenue for Moscow. The goal of ultimately getting rid of Russian gas could prove even more difficult. In the United States, President Joe Biden and Democrats are under enormous pressure to prove they're serious about fighting inflation ahead of the midterm elections in November, even though most factors causing it, such as supply chain snarls and high consumer demand, are largely beyond their control. That could complicate efforts to continue to apply pressure on Russia, despite warnings from billionaire George Soros and others that appeasement of Putin would have catastrophic consequences.  Fuel and food prices shoot up At Davos, leaders from government and business stressed that they cannot capitulate to Putin. They agreed that the response to his annexation of Crimea in 2014, as well as the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England in 2018, was far too weak in hindsight. And the West's historic sanctions against Russia this year may not be enough, either. Russia's economy has been battered, but is holding up better than expected, bolstered in part by robust oil and gas revenues. That allowed the central bank to slash interest rates on Thursday. \"We have to stop compromising,\" Eduard Heger, the prime minister of Slovakia, said with emotion during a panel discussion. Compromising with Putin caused \"an aggressive war,\" he continued. Speaking to dinner guests, Soros warned that the invasion of Ukraine could mark the beginning of World War III, and said that Putin had to be defeated \"as soon as possible\" if the world wants to preserve civilization. But the economic backdrop could make life harder for politicians back home. Annual Inflation among the 19 countries that use the euro reached 7.4% in April, an all-time high. In the United States, inflation stood at 8.3%, and it hit 9% in the United Kingdom. A big factor is energy costs. They were already rising due to a supply and demand imbalance after the pandemic, but have been driven even higher by Europe's efforts to cut its dependence on Russian energy. An oil embargo has been held up by landlocked states like Hungary and the Czech Republic, which say they would need years to make the transition to other suppliers or energy sources. It is expected to be agreed in the coming weeks, however. \"The economic situation is definitely challenging. I don't think it's going to impact consensus on oil,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. Still, there will be consequences. Fears of energy shortages have already dramatically pushed up prices. In the United States, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline reached a record $4.60 on Thursday. The situation is even worse in Europe. Recent data shows drivers in the United Kingdom paying $8.06 per gallon, and $8.43 per gallon in Germany. At the same time, food prices are jumping as the war disrupts exports of key products such as wheat and sunflower oil, and as some countries like India subsequently enact export bans to protect domestic supplies. In April, food prices in Germany shot up 8.6% compared to the previous year. \"This is where the impact of the war in Ukraine is becoming more and more visible,\" Georg Thiel, president of Germany's Federal Statistical Office, said earlier this month. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted this week that \"it is fragile countries and vulnerable populations that suffer most.\" She added that bread prices have increased 70% in Lebanon, and food shipments from Ukraine's Odessa haven't been able to reach Somalia, which is battling a devastating drought. Protests over rising prices have broken out in Peru and led to the prime minister's ouster in Sri Lanka. However, even in Europe and the United States, lower-income households have increasingly been forced to choose between \"heating and eating,\" which account for a bigger proportion of their budgets. Economists worry that a pullback in spending could trigger recessions, especially as central banks raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. \"There's real risk for lots of people,\" Oxfam International Executive Director Gabriela Bucher told CNN Business. Even in the \"rich world,\" she added, there are people struggling \"to fulfill their basic needs at the moment.\" The British government acknowledged the problem Thursday when it announced a $6.3 billion windfall tax on oil companies to fund payments to people struggling with energy bills.  The future of Western solidarity American and European officials and top corporate brass say Ukraine's victory is crucial. The brutal war and humanitarian crisis must come to an end, and democratic values have to prevail at what Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz called a \"turning point\" for the world. \"It's hard to see any issue that has united people in the West as much as this issue,\" David Rubenstein, the billionaire founder of the Carlyle Group, told CNN Business. \"I don't think that the incremental increases that might be attributed to this with respect to inflation are going to change anybody's views.\" American officials also see standing up to Putin as imperative to curtailing the ambitions of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who they say is closely watching how the situation plays out. \"Deterrence is a key here,\" said US Congressman Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"As Xi looks at what's happening in Ukraine, [he's asking,] 'Is it worth it?' And we have to persuade him that it's not.\" But balancing politics and economic concerns won't be simple. Scholz conceded that \"politicians have an important task to attend to\" as they juggle different parts of their mandate from the public.  This could become a larger issue in the event of a major escalation by Russia, Rahman said. That could trigger louder calls for a full ban on Russian natural gas, which accounted for 45% of Europe's supplies last year. Much travels by pipeline, which makes it more difficult to find alternatives. That's not on the table right now, though Scholz said Germany is working \"flat out\" to end its reliance on Russian gas as soon as possible. But if it came under serious discussion, it would be a trickier sell than anything else the West has so far proposed. Companies, while telegraphing strong support for Ukraine, are also worried about growing pressure on their businesses. Herbert Diess, the CEO of Volkswagen, told CNN Business that the full effects of rising raw material costs and inflation wouldn't be apparent for another six or 12 months, creating a \"really tough\" operating environment. \"We should achieve something with sanctions,\" he said. \"So far, we're going basically from escalation to escalation and we have no choice. So I think sanctions, yes, but then how are we going to end this?\" Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State, sparked a backlash earlier this week when he appeared to suggest that Ukraine should agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea to Putin. \"Negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome,\" Kissinger said. \"Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante.\" Zelensky compared Kissinger's comments to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938.  \"I do not want to hear the word 'appeasement' anymore,\" European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said Wednesday, to applause. Still, a weakening economy and high inflation could weigh on politicians as they return home, sparking a warning from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \"Freedom is more important than free trade,\" Stoltenberg told the Davos crowd. \"The protection of our values is more important than profit.\"",
