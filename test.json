    "body": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined the Biden administration's strategy towards China, seeking to refocus attention on what he called \"the most serious long-term challenge to the international order.\" In a lengthy speech delivered at George Washington University Thursday, the top US diplomat outlined the administration's approach as \"invest, align, compete,\" and said that although the United States does not seek conflict with China, it is prepared to defend its interests. \"We will invest in the foundations of our strength at home -- our competitiveness, our innovation, our democracy. We will align our efforts with our network of allies and partners, acting with common purpose and in common cause. And harnessing these two key assets, we'll compete with China to defend our interests and build our vision for the future,\" said Blinken. The speech comes as much of the focus of the United States -- and the global community -- has been turned to Russia's war in Ukraine.  Blinken highlighted \"Beijing's defense of President Putin's war to erase Ukraine's sovereignty and secure a sphere of influence in Europe,\" saying it \"should raise alarm bells for all of us, who call the Indo-Pacific region home,\" and more broadly emphasized the importance of focusing on the threats he said the Chinese government poses to the world, even as the war in Ukraine wages on. \"China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it,\" Blinken said. Blinken's roughly 40-minute long speech sought to underscore the degree to which the Washington-Beijing relationship is \"one of the most complex and consequential relationships of any that we have in the world today.\"  As he broadly described how the US intends to approach that relationship, he drew sharp distinctions between the two nations, describing things like China's \"repressive\" government, unfair trade practices and human rights abuses. However, the top US diplomat also repeatedly stressed that the US does not seek to stymy China as a world power or change its political system, nor does it seek a clash with it. \"We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. To the contrary, we're determined to avoid both,\" Blinken said.  He said the US is ready to strengthen diplomacy and increase communication with China \"across a full range of issues,\" and is prepared to work together on matters of mutual interest like climate change and Covid-19, noting that \"even as we invest, align and compete, or together with Beijing, where our interests come together.\" \"We can't let the disagreements that divide us stop us from moving forward on the priorities that demand that we work together for the good of our people and for the good of the world,\" he said. Blinken noted that \"this is a charged moment for the world.\" \"And at times like these, diplomacy is vital,\" the top US diplomat said. \"It's how we make clear our profound concerns, better understand each other's perspective, and have no doubt about each other's intentions.\" \"We stand ready to increase our direct communication with Beijing across a full range of issues. And we hope that can happen,\" he continued. New State Department China team As a means to try to foster that diplomacy, Blinken said he was determined to give the State Department the necessary tools, including \"building a 'China House,' a department-wide integrated team that will coordinate and implement our policy across issues and regions, working with Congress as needed.\" \"We remain committed to intense diplomacy, alongside intense competition,\" he said. However, Blinken also warned, \"we can't rely on Beijing to change its trajectory. So we will shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open and inclusive international system.\" \"We don't seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China -- or any country for that matter -- from growing their economy or advancing the interests of their people. But we will defend and strengthen the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations, and make it possible for all countries -- including the United States and China -- to coexist and cooperate,\" Blinken said.   On Taiwan, the top US diplomat again stressed that US policy towards the island over which China claims sovereignty has not changed, despite comments by President Joe Biden last week that the US would respond militarily if Beijing attacked Taiwan. \"We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We do not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means,\" Blinken said. However, Blinken noted that \"while our policy has not changed, what has changed is Beijing's growing coercion, like trying to cut off Taiwan's relations with countries around the world and blocking it from participating in international organizations, and Beijing is engaged in increasingly provocative rhetoric and activity, like flying PLA aircraft near Taiwan on an almost daily basis.\" \"These words and actions are deeply destabilizing. They risk miscalculation and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. As we saw from the President's discussions with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, maintaining peace and stability across the street is not just a US interest, it is a matter of international concern, critical to regional and global security and prosperity.\" The top US diplomat also emphasized the importance of ensuring that even as tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, ire is not focused the people of China or those of Chinese descent in the US. \"We also know from our history that when we're managing a challenging relationship with another government, people from that country or with that heritage can be made to feel that they don't belong here, or that they're our adversaries. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said. \"Mistreating someone of Chinese descent goes against everything we stand for as a country,\" Blinken continued, noting that the \"differences are between governments and systems, not between our people.\"",

    "body": "The economy is close to entering a recession, perhaps as soon as this year. To avoid taking too much of a financial hit, Americans will need to prepare.  Last summer, we wrote that US economic growth was already starting to slow and the economy would keep decelerating in the coming months. That is already proving to be true, with year-over-year GDP growth declining from 12.2% in the second quarter of 2021 to 3.5% in the first quarter of this year. The Commerce Department commonly cites GDP growth as the annualized percentage change from one quarter to another, but those numbers tend to gyrate much more than the year-over-year figures. Nevertheless, both data points show the slowdown in economic growth between 2021 and 2022.  And there is a toxic brew of external economic headwinds, including the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China, resulting in supply shocks that boost inflation and slow growth.  A key part of the inflation problem is linked to the massive $3.9 trillion in fiscal stimulus injected into the economy in 2020 and 2021, alongside well over a hundred billion dollars in bonds the Federal Reserve was buying each month since the height of the pandemic.  Of course, when economic slowdowns take hold, it makes sense for the Fed to try and shore up economic growth by cutting interest rates. But in this case, the Fed is trying to make up for failing to react to inflation sooner. We warned last year that inflation was getting out of hand. The central bank should have taken action last summer.   Now the Fed has little choice but to tighten policy by aggressively cutting rates to curb inflation. That materially increases the risk of pushing the economy into a full-blown recession.  It was only six months ago that the Fed began slowing its asset purchases. And it finally started rate hikes just two months ago, but at that point overall inflation had already shot up to a 40-year high, impacting Americans in every corner of the country.  For the average investor, it's hard to find a place to hide. Recessions are usually accompanied by outright bear markets, with stocks falling by well over 20%, and often by much more. And with the Fed now hiking rates aggressively, the bond market is no safe haven. Equities and bonds are riskier than usual, and surging inflation means that even cash under the mattress is losing its purchasing power.  What can Americans do? One answer may be to do nothing, and just try and ride out the volatility without trying to time the market. For those willing to lock up some money for at least a year, inflation-protected Treasury bonds could be part of the mix.  Consumers might consider cutting back on non-essential spending, especially avoiding splurging on big-ticket items. With recession storm clouds looming, it is a good idea to sock some money away for a rainy day.  And for job seekers, because recessions lead to major job losses, now is the time to update the resume and make any career moves while the job market is still hot. Keep in mind: The relatively secure jobs are with companies whose products or services customers need day in and day out — even during a recession — making such firms less vulnerable to the economy's troubles.  There will be more difficult economic news to come. And prudence calls for skepticism about any soothing words from the Fed, the Biden administration or Wall Street bulls about a hoped-for soft landing. But preparing ahead of time can help soften the blow. Having missed the opportunity to raise rates last year, the Fed is now risking recession in order to tame inflation. As a result, realistically and objectively, it's time to be on guard. ",

    "body": "A ransomware attack has forced officials in a 345,000-person New Jersey county to switch off their computers and set up temporary Gmail accounts so the public can email key agencies such as the health, emergency and sheriff's departments.  The hacking incident in central New Jersey's Somerset County, which began Tuesday, has disrupted services that rely on the county's databases, including accessing land and probate records, the county said in a statement. The ransomware attack has only affected email and IT systems; phone lines and emergency service systems are all working properly, the county said.  The hack also affected a web form through which residents can request replacement mail-in ballots for New Jersey's primary election next month. Residents can still call to request a replacement ballot or do so in-person, Nathan Rudy, Somerset County's director of public information, told CNN.  Rudy said it would be \"at least until the end of the week\" before the county's digital infrastructure would be fully functional after the hack.  It was unclear who was responsible for the hack. Rudy said the FBI was investigating the incident. CNN has requested comment from the FBI. The Somerset County hack is only the latest ransomware incident to hamper local government services in the US, which often struggle with resources to counter hacks. It marks the 22nd US state or local government to be hit by ransomware in 2022, according to Allan Liska, senior intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future In his first year in office, President Joe Biden exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in cybercriminals operating from Russian soil, some of whom had allegedly conducted high-profile hacks of US critical infrastructure.  While Russian authorities in January detained someone that US officials believe was responsible for the 2021 ransomware attack on US fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline, any bilateral progress on the issue appears to have stalled after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  With many alleged ransomware operatives living in Ukraine and Russia, the jury is still out on how the war in Ukraine has affected the ransomware ecosystem. Senior National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said Wednesday that there had been a decline in ransomware attacks against US organizations since the war began. But gathering authoritative data on ransomware attacks is difficult, as many victims do not report hacks. And US officials and private analysts have warned that the threat of ransomware will remain.

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi held a telephone call on Thursday and discussed the situation in Ukraine and the issue of global food security, according to readouts of the call from both the governments.  The Italian readout released following the call said the discussion between the two leaders focused on the situation in Ukraine and "efforts to find a shared solution to the ongoing food crisis and its serious repercussions on the poorest countries in the world."  The Kremlin in its readout said that Putin emphasized that Moscow is ready to make a "significant contribution" to avoid the food crisis through the export of grain and fertilizers, if the West lifts "politically motivated restrictions" on Russia.  "Noting the groundlessness of accusations with the supply of agricultural products to world markets, Vladimir Putin drew attention to the fact that the difficulties that have arisen are related, among other things, to disruptions in the operation of production and logistics chains, as well as the financial policy of Western countries during the coronavirus pandemic. The situation was aggravated due to anti-Russian restrictions imposed by the United States and the European Union," the Kremlin statement said.  Putin also informed Draghi about the "ongoing work to establish a peaceful life in the liberated cities of Donbas," the Kremlin said, adding the Russian leader also gave "fundamental assessments of the negotiation process frozen by Kyiv.\" "When discussing energy security issues, the intention of the Russian side to continue to ensure uninterrupted supplies of natural gas to Italy at prices fixed in contracts was confirmed," it said.  Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin visited Kyiv — as well as the cities of Irpin and Bucha — Thursday and meet with local residents and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.  She announced plans for additional support for Ukraine, including an increase in arms deliveries. After hearing testimonies about alleged atrocities committed by Russian soldiers, Marin emphasized that Finland supports Ukraine and the International Criminal Court bringing the perpetrators to justice, according to a Finnish government statement, and that there will be "no room for impunity.\" During the visit, Marin strongly condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, calling them \"a blatant violation of the UN Charter and international law,\" the statement said. "It is important for the European Union to be united, bold and determined in the face of Russia's invasion," Marin stressed, adding that "it is important to create concrete steps for Ukraine to become an EU Member State.\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions from the West have sent oil prices skyrocketing, lifting gasoline and diesel prices in the United States to unprecedented levels. Natural gas prices also have climbed around the world. After the West imposed tough penalties on Russia, Putin warned that "unfriendly" nationswould need to pay for crucial Russian shipments of natural gas in rubles instead of euros. Following payment disputes, Russia has turned off the flow gas to Finland, Bulgaria and Poland. "I wouldn't trust them," US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN in response to a question about whether Russia will ever again be considered a reliable energy supplier. "They have to prove they are a reliable partner and they're certainly not doing that." "They are weaponizing energy, which is another reason why as a nation, we should move to energy sources that cannot be weaponized," Granholm said while speaking from a General Electric wind turbine testing facility in New Orleans. Of course, Russia could argue that the West is also weaponizing energy. The United States and other countries have banned imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal, while Europe is debating similar steps.  Keep reading here. Brent crude oil climbed on Thursday to the highest level since late March, signaling more pain for drivers filling up at the gas pump. Brent, the world benchmark, jumped 2.8% to $117.25 a barrel in recent trading. Brent hit an intraday high of $117.39 a barrel, the highest since March 28.  Investors are watching nervously as European officials attempt to reach an agreement on phasing out Russian oil, a step that would further scramble energy flows.  "Oil prices keep grinding higher and it's tough to see how that doesn't continue if an oil embargo is put into place," said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at data and analytics firm Kpler. Oil prices remain significantly below the recent peak set in March during the initial shock after Russia invaded Ukraine. Brent topped out at $139.13 a barrel in early March, while US oil hit $130.50 a barrel.  "We have an orderly march higher, rather than some panic-induced price spike," Smith said.  Gas prices are at record highs, though they have begun to level out. The US national average for regular gasoline edged higher on Thursday to a fresh record of $4.60 a gallon, according to AAA. That's 30% more expensive than the day before Russia invaded Ukraine. Russian forces have lost "nearly about 1,000 tanks" and "well over 350 artillery pieces," as well as "almost three dozen fighter bomber fixed-wing aircraft and more than 50 helicopters" so far in the ongoing war in Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday. Still, with all of that loss, the US assesses that Russians "still have the … majority of their capability left to them," the official added. "They have invested an awful lot of their hardware and their personnel in this fight, and the Ukrainians have suffered losses, the Russians have suffered losses.\" "Russians do have a superiority here in terms of number of assets they can apply to this fight in terms of people, and equipment and weapons, and we just have to bear that in mind," the official added. There are now 110 operational Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside of Ukraine, which is an increase from 97 BTGs the US assessed were inside of Ukraine as of May 9, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday. That is an increase of about 13 BTGs in about two and a half weeks.  "The largest contingent remains in the south. But the western grouping, the central grouping and the eastern grouping each have roughly the same number of BTGs inside Ukraine," the official said. Russian forces have made "some incremental gains" in their push towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the official added, "not a lot but some incremental gains." Around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the US assesses that Ukrainians have "continued to push Russian forces further away\" in a range of "a few kilometers to more than 10 kilometers within the Russian border," the official said, "so no major change there." Meanwhile, 85 of the M-777 howitzers that the US has provided to Ukraine over the course of the last three military assistance packages are "forward," meaning they are being used on the frontlines of the war, the official told reporters Thursday.  Out of the 209,000 155 mm projectiles that were promised to Ukraine from the US, 190,000 of them have been transferred to Ukraine, the official added.  Nine of the 11 total Mi-17 helicopters the US promised to Ukraine have been transferred to Ukraine. The last two helicopters will arrive either "later this month or very early in June," the official said. US and NATO allies continue to train Ukrainian soldiers on US and NATO weapons systems outside of Ukraine, the official added. 419 Ukrainians soldiers have completed M-777 howitzer training, about 30 Ukrainians have completed the basic howitzer maintenance course, and another 17 have completed the more advanced 14-day maintainer course for the Howitzer systems, the official continued. About 20 Ukrainian soldiers are completing the second iteration of the training on the Phoenix Ghost Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, that the US provided to Ukraine, the official added.  The US is "also helping facilitate training" for Ukrainians on coastal defense missiles now that Denmark has agreed to contribute Harpoon launchers and vehicles to Ukraine, the official said. "Some training that needs to be done on how to use the Harpoon was not designed for coastal defense, it was designed for anti-ship warfare, ship-to-ship warfare, so this is a relatively new application of the missile, and therefore we know they're going to need a little bit of training on that," the official said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed peace proposals that would \"appease\" Russia in a speech Thursday to the parliament of Latvia.  \"There are people — and many of them among the powerful of this world — who believe that not all nations matter, who believe that a nation can simply be forgotten to try to keep peace,\" Zelensky said. \"Even the temporary peace, even the illusory one. Even peace at the cost of tens of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands deported, or millions deprived of their homeland. They are OK with that. Peace at the cost of the lives of others. But this should not be normal.\" Zelensky's remarks follow remarks from former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who appeared to suggest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that peace negotiations should be aimed at \"status quo ante\" boundaries that preceded the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 — in essence, conceding Crimea and parts of the Donbas to Russia. It also comes amid reports that Italy has concocted its own embryonic peace plan. \"Now we hear again that Russia should be given what it wants,\" Zelensky said. \"That supposedly it is necessary to accept that some nations may be deprived of part of their foreign policy rights, because certain — as they say — 'historical force' wants it. There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly 'appease' the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed — of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops.\"  In his remarks to the Latvian parliament, the Ukrainian president urged additional sanctions on Russia, particularly on its powerful energy sector exports.  \"It is necessary not only to finally agree on the sixth sanctions package against the Russian Federation, including the embargo on oil, oil blends and petroleum products,\" he said. \"But also prepare the seventh sanctions package, with even more powerful restrictions on Russia for terror against Ukraine. Just like Latvia, the whole of Europe must restrict Russia's energy weapons. Fully.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed China for defending Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, saying that defense "should raise alarm bells for all of us who call the Indo-Pacific region home." "Even while Russia was clearly mobilizing to invade Ukraine, President Xi and President Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was, and I quote, 'without limits,'" Blinken said in a speech on the Biden administration's policy towards China at George Washington University. He emphasized that the US is not seeking a conflict or a new Cold War with China. "Our task is to prove once again, that democracy can meet urgent challenges, create opportunity, advance human dignity, that the future belongs to those who believe in freedom and that all countries will be free to chart their own paths without coercion," said Blinken. "We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. To the contrary, we're determined to avoid both.\" \"Even as President Putin's war continues, we will remain focused on the most serious long-term challenge to the international order – and that's posed by the People's Republic of China," he added.  Grain shortages around the world caused by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine are "being felt on the African continent," the nominee to be the next top US general overseeing the US military presence in Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, told lawmakers Thursday. Cavoli, who currently serves as commander of US Army Europe-Africa, said he saw the impacts of the grain shortage on a recent trip to Kenya. "There was a significant impact there already. We know that in other countries such as Tunisia, the prices have skyrocketed for basic foodstuffs. So there is food insecurity in Africa that is being provoked by the shortage of grain," Cavoli said. While the shortage is being experienced in Africa, this will "largely be a European concern, because of the close connection between African security issues and European security issues," he added. Some countries, like Germany and Romania, are already starting to try to alleviate the problem, Cavoli said.  Romania has "made the port at Constanța available," Cavoli said, but that port will only allow "about 90,000 tons" of grain a day through, while there's about 22 million tons of grain backed up, he added. The German national railroad agency, Deutsche Bahn, also recently announced a new plan called the Berlin train lift to "dedicate trains to pulling wheat right out of Ukraine into western Europe," Cavoli said. "Poland has established a new border crossing regime with Germany to facilitate that. So I think some efforts are taking place, much more remains to be done, senator," he told lawmakers.  He also addressed the NATO bids of Finland and Sweden, saying they will bring "quite a lot of capability and capacity" to the alliance if they join. Cavoli is nominated to succeed the current US European Command Commander Gen. Tod Wolters. Russian forces are applying a wide array of weapons across several fronts in eastern Ukraine as they try to break down stubborn Ukrainian defenses, which are outnumbered and outgunned, according to Ukrainian officials. Several of those officials describe the situation as \"very difficult\" and admit Ukrainian units may have to fall back in some places. In recent days, Ukrainian officials say, the Russians have combined short-range ballistic missiles, multiple-launch rocket systems, heavy artillery and tanks in a remorseless bombardment of towns and cities in Luhansk and Donetsk regions still under Ukrainian control. The National Police of Ukraine said that civilians were killed in attacks on 13 settlements in Donetsk, with several towns not previously targeted suffering damage. Russian forces seem to be broadening the number of towns they are shelling as they try to destroy Ukrainian defenses and supply lines.  Their chief objective appears to be taking Sloviansk, which has seen an increase in shelling in recent days. Mayor Vadym Liakh said half the city is now without water, and there will be \"no gas supply until the heating season.\" A growing number of Ukrainian officials describe the military situation in dire terms, although Russian advances on the ground have been modest. Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of Ukraine's parliament who is on the National Security Committee, described the situation as \"difficult.\" He told Ukrainian television that \"the hottest spots are Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. The enemy is trying to encircle our troops.\"   The twin cities in Luhansk are almost entirely destroyed, but Ukrainian troops are still present. Nearly 15,000 civilians are estimated still to be in Severodonetsk. According to the Institute for the Study of War's latest battlefield assessment, \"Russian forces may need to conduct a ground offensive on Severodonetsk in upcoming days to maintain their pace after committing a significant portion of personnel, artillery, aviation, and logistics to the front.\" Venislavskyi said that if the Russians could break Ukrainian resistance there, \"their next targets are Bakhmut, Soledar,\" towns that are further west. In particular, regional officials say that the highway linking Bakhmut and Lysychansk — a resupply route for Ukrainian forces — is under constant attack. \"The enemy partially controls Lyman and goes to the outskirts of Severodonetsk. The situation in this operational area will be very difficult in the coming days,\" he said. He also suggested that additional Russian forces were being brought in, saying \"the enemy continues to accumulate reserves near Izium to attack Sloviansk and Barvinkove.\" \"The enemy is sending units from the Primorsky Krai, the Far East, and Siberia to Ukraine. Battalion groups are formed, loaded on the railway and sent to Ukraine,\" Venislavskyi said.  Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said the \"Armed Forces have been defending for the fourth month now. Our defensive positions are destroyed by the enemy every day.\" \"Luhansk region, the part that is under the control of Ukraine, is very small in terms of territory. Therefore, the Russians will try their best to take it. For them, this is the easiest way to win at least some intermediate victory. ... Our forces are gradually moving to more fortified positions,\" he said. Haidai is one of several Ukrainian officials to stress that the defenses in the east are vastly outnumbered.  \"You need to understand that a huge amount of equipment and people are fighting against us,\" he said. \"It takes time for [Western] weapons to reach us. They must pass from the west to the east of Ukraine. One or two howitzers will not change the position; we will simply lose them. Therefore, we need to wait and regroup,\" Haidai said.  He also acknowledged the probability that Ukrainian forces would have to fall back. \"Perhaps we will have to leave one more two settlements. But we need to win the war, not the battle,\" Haidai said. Rostyslav Smirnov, an adviser to the minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, told Ukrainian television that \"the advantage of the Russians in [terms of] personnel is eight to one,\" and the advantage in equipment more than twice that. Two captured Russian soldiers pleaded guilty in Kotelevsky court in Ukraine's Poltava region on Thursday to "violating laws and customs of war conducted with preliminary group conspiracy." Oleksandr Bobykin and Oleksandr Ivanov are accused of firing Grad rockets from Russia's Belgorod region towards Ukraine's Kharkiv region on Feb. 24. According to the case details made public on the court website, the men fired artillery and damaged "objects of civil and critical infrastructure, including private homes" in Kazacha Lopan and Veterynrne in the Kharkiv region. The soldiers were captured by Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv region, according to the court memos.  The court is due to deliver a verdict on May 31. At least four people have been killed and seven more wounded in shelling of regional centers in the Kharkiv area, according to Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the regional military administration.  In a message posted on his Telegram channel on Thursday, Syniehubov urged residents to stay in shelters during the ongoing exchanges of fire between Ukrainian and Russian forces. "The most intense fighting is happening in Izium region. The Russian forces are trying to improve their strategic positions in the Izium area and renew their offensive on Sloviansk," he said.  Syniehubov added that a number of other towns have been shelled in the last 24 hours, including Pyatyhatky, Balakliya, Tsyrkuny and the Chuhuyiv area. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO in a phone call on Thursday. According to a Élysée Palace readout of the call, Macron stressed to Erdogan \"the importance of respecting the sovereign choice of these two countries\" which he maintained was \"the result of a democratic process\" and \"a reaction to the evolution of their security environment.\" Erdogan has voiced his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance, claiming that their alleged sheltering of Kurdish \"terrorist organizations\" should bar them from entry.  The Turkish president told Macron that \"Sweden and Finland's contacts with individuals and so-called organizations under the control of the terrorist organization PKK/YPG would not be compatible with the spirit of alliance under NATO," according to the Turkish Directorate of Communications readout of the call.   The two leaders also addressed the food security crisis, focusing particularly on the \"urgent need to enable the export of Ukrainian grain,\" according to the Élysée.  \"They discussed the various possible ways to transport crops out of Ukraine, identified in conjunction with the United Nations, and agreed to remain in contact in order to find a solution quickly,\" the Élysée said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Eurasian Economic Union partners to choose "natural" partners and neighbors over other "well developed" economies on Thursday. Putin spoke via video link at the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) forum opening in Bishkek. He added there are more than 180 projects worth $300 billion on the EAEU forum agenda. EAEU is an economic union of post-Soviet economies initiated by Russia in 2015 to create a single market for Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It's impossible to \"switch off\" Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"imperialist\" aims, the German Chancellor said Thursday. In his closing speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Olaf Scholz said that the horrors in Ukraine cannot be ignored.  \"It keeps us up at night … will it expand beyond the borders of Ukraine?\" He said Putin will only seriously negotiate peace if his army can't break Ukrainian defensive forces, with neither Ukraine nor the European Union accepting peace dictated by Putin.  Scholz's comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky criticized Henry Kissinger's remarks after the former US Secretary of State appeared to suggest that Ukraine agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea. Zelensky on Wednesday compared Kissenger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938. Meanwhile, Scholz said that NATO \"will not become a party to this war,\" as that would put nuclear powers in opposition to each other. He added that Germany will welcome Sweden and Finland into NATO with \"open arms.\" Earlier, Scholz spoke of the war's impact on the international community, stressing \"we cannot let Putin win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it.\" He added that his country would be ready to defend itself at all times in light of Russia's actions. Russia plans to take the whole of Ukraine, with the capital of Kyiv being its main target, according to city mayor Vitali Klitschko. It is clear that Russia is not carrying out a \"special operation\" but rather a \"genocide\" in Ukraine, Klitschko said during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. He warned that Ukraine is not only defending its own sovereignty, but that of all like-minded nations.  \"We defend not just our families, we defend all of you,\" said Klitschko. \"We defend you because we have the same values.\" The war is a danger to Europe and the whole world, Klitschko said. He made a plea for \"fast decisions\" from other leaders on sending Ukraine more defensive weapons, which he says they need quickly. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has spoken out against Russia's \"bullying\" and \"atrocities\" in Ukraine during a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Thursday. Truss used an address to the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to speak out against Russian maneuvering in the Balkan nation, and urged partners to continue to rally behind Ukraine. \"As Russia meddles here, Putin's troops are committing atrocities just 700 miles away in Ukraine. The people of Ukraine need our support,\" said Truss. \"They need that support from the whole of Europe, from the whole of the free world. We need to back the people in their brave fight for their country,\" she added, urging allies not to compromise with or appease Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We have seen Russia's bullying tactics – just this week flagrantly saying they will let Ukrainian grain flow only if sanctions on them are lifted,\" said Truss. \"That is trying to hold the world to ransom, and it must not succeed. So now it is about digging deep, not backsliding,\" she added. \"Democracy and freedom must prevail over autocratic aggression,\" said Truss. \"Putin must lose in Ukraine. Putin's aggression must never succeed in Europe.\" Germany is working \"flat out\" to end its reliance on Russian gas imports, the country's Chancellor said Thursday, adding there was \"no doubt\" that both Berlin and the European Union would end their dependence on energy imports from Moscow. Russian oil could be completely phased out by the end of the year, Olaf Scholz added during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said Germany was looking towards liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and alternative sources of supply. The EU is following the \"same path,\" Scholz said. However, Ukraine is asking for maximum sanctions against Moscow, including an immediate ban on Russian oil and trade.  This restructuring will have an impact on EU economies, which is already being felt by a rise in energy prices, he warned.  Some background: Germany was one of Russia's largest importers of oil last year.  Before the Ukraine crisis, an $11 billion undersea pipeline -- Nord Stream 2 -- was being built to deliver gas from Russia to Germany.  In February, when Russia invaded, Germany halted its approval of the pipeline, leaving the 1,230-kilometer (764-mile) pipeline empty since its completion in September 2021. Russia says that \"illegal actions\" by the West are causing problems with grain supplies in Europe, after the Kremlin was accused of obstructing grain exports from Ukraine. \"We absolutely reject these accusations,\" presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists Thursday. \"On the contrary, we blame countries of the West for taking a number of illegal actions that have led to this 'blockade.'\" Asked whether this meant Western sanctions need to be lifted in order for grain supplies to resume, Peskov said: \"They must cancel those illegal decisions that prevent the charter of ships, the export of grain, etc.\" Earlier this week, the head of the UN World Food Programme called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to reopen blocked ports in Ukraine to prevent a global food crisis.  And European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has accused Putin of \"weaponizing\" food supplies in his invasion of Ukraine by confiscating grain supplies and machinery, as well as blocking exports from ports in the Black Sea. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, wheat supplies from Russia and Ukraine accounted for almost 30% of global trade.  Russian attacks on the key city of Severodonetsk continue Thursday, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that the war in Ukraine puts at risk the \"system of international cooperation that was forged after two world wars.\" Here's the latest on Russia's war in Ukraine: Massive Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine: On Wednesday alone Russian troops fired on 41 settlements in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, said Ukraine's Joint Forces Task Force in a statement Thursday. \"As a result of enemy shelling, 6 people were killed and 12 were injured,\" said the statement.\nBattle for Severodonetsk: Russian shelling of residential neighborhoods in the industrial city, which is key to controlling Luhansk, hasn't stopped for more than a week, Oleksandr Striuk, head of the Severodonetsk military administration, said in a radio interview Thursday. Russian forces have also been shelling a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, added Striuk.\nRussian attacks in Donetsk: Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" on the key town of Lyman in the neighboring Donetsk region. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control there, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the southeast of the town become more at risk of encirclement. Zelensky criticizes Kissinger: Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has made a blistering attack on Henry Kissinger, after the former US Secretary of State appeared to suggest that Ukraine should cede territory to Russia in peace negotiations. Zelensky compared Kissinger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938.\nScholz fires warning at Davos: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that Europe and the international community are at a critical point, and said the world has changed since the Ukraine war began. \"The world is at a turning point,\" said Scholz during a special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that not only is Ukraine at risk but also the \"system of international cooperation that was forged after two world wars.\"\nRussia cuts interest rates: A resurgent ruble — buoyed by robust oil and gas revenues — has taken some of the heat out of inflation and allowed Russia's Central Bank to cut interest rates. On Thursday, the bank announced that rates will fall from 14% to 11%, after inflation slowed to 17.5% in May compared to 17.8% in April. It is now forecasting that annual inflation will decrease to 5–7% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024. \nPortugal approves Chelsea sale: The Portuguese government has authorized the sale of Chelsea FC, the London football team owned by Roman Abramovich, a Russian businessman and Kremlin ally. An ownership group led by Todd Boehly looks set to take control of the club after the UK government and the English Premier League also approved the deal this week.\nFood crisis: Russia is trying to \"blackmail\" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukraine's foreign minister said. He warned that if Moscow does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a \"multi-year food crisis.\" ##Catch Up## Russian troops attacked more than 40 towns in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions Wednesday, according to Ukraine's Joint Forces Task Force, indicating the scale of a major Russian offensive in the Donbas region. \"During the day, on May 25, Russian troops fired on 41 settlements in Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\" the statement on Facebook Thursday read. \"As a result of enemy shelling, 6 people were killed and 12 were injured.\" According to the statement, Russian fire destroyed or damaged 52 high-rise and private residential buildings and other civilian facilities, as well as railway lines and agricultural buildings.  Over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian rescuers had evacuated about 760 people from areas of active combat, the statement added. The Ukrainian cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk are under Russian assault amid an offensive in the eastern Luhansk region, the Office of the President of Ukraine said in an update Thursday.  Severodonetsk -- an industrial city situated across the Siverskyi Donets river from Lysychansk -- has been under heavy shelling, and the statement said the Impulse Research and Production Association and 11 high-rise buildings in the city had been destroyed. Oleksandr Striuk, head of the Severodonetsk military administration, said in a radio interview Thursday that the connection between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk had been \"complicated\" because of Russian shelling of a bridge between the two cities. The enemy hasn't stopped shelling residential neighborhoods for the past one-and-a-half weeks, Striuk said.  \"12,000 -- 13,000 people remain in the city. People are hiding in shelters and basements. The city is under constant fire.\" Striuk added that communication was limited and that 90% of Severodonetsk's housing stock had been damaged or destroyed. The fall of Severodonetsk -- the last major city in the Luhansk region under Ukrainian government control -- would be a major setback for Kyiv. \"The situation is difficult, especially in the Donetsk operational district,\" said Fedir Venislavskyi, a Ukrainian lawmaker and member of the parliamentary Committee for National Security, Defense and Intelligence.  \"The hottest spots are Severodonetsk and Lysychansk,\" he said, adding that Russian soldiers were trying to encircle Ukrainian troops before next targeting the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar.  \"The enemy partially controls Lyman and is going to the outskirts of Severodonetsk. The situation in this operational area will be very difficult in the coming days,\" Venislavskyi said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that Europe and the international community are at a critical point, and said the world has changed since the Ukraine war began. \"The world is at a turning point,\" said Scholz during a special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that, not only is Ukraine at risk, but also the \"system of international cooperation that was forged after two world wars.\" The war was a \"thunderbolt,\" but the prospect of Russia \"capturing Ukraine seems less likely than it did at the beginning\" of the invasion, said Scholz, citing the fierce resistance by Ukrainian troops and help from the international community. Moscow has failed in its military objectives so far, but succeeded in uniting the international community and fast forwarding Ukraine's plan to join the European Union, he added.  \"We cannot let Putin win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it,\" said Scholz. He added that Germany will equip its army so it's ready at \"all times\" to defend itself \"under the new conditions\" dictated by Russia. Germany is in the process of changing its constitution to make this happen, hoping to make more than $105 million available to modernize its armed forces, he added.  \"It is the security of our country that is at stake,\" he said. \"We are sending an unequivocal message to our allies that you can rely on Germany.\" Russia slashed interest rates on Thursday as a resurgent ruble — buoyed by robust oil and gas revenues — takes some of the heat out of inflation. The Russian Central Bank cut interest rates from 14% to 11%, after inflation slowed to 17.5% in May compared to 17.8% in April, said the bank, which is now forecasting that annual inflation will decrease to 5–7% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024.  The bank raised interest rates to 20% as the Russian economy was hit by Western sanctions, but the latest move means they are now almost the same as before the invasion of Ukraine, when they stood at 9.5%.  \"External conditions for the Russian economy are still challenging, considerably constraining economic activity,\" said the bank. \"Financial stability risks decreased somewhat, enabling a relaxation of some capital control measures.\" Reacting to the decision, William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that additional rate cuts and easing of capital controls seem likely. \"The key point is that high oil and gas revenues are providing policymakers with a lifeline, allowing them to row back emergency economic measures,\" said Jackson. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the economy was \"withstanding the impact of sanctions\" despite a gloomy outlook. \"Despite all the difficulties, the Russian economy is withstanding the impact of the sanctions, and withstanding it quite well,\" Putin said in a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.  \"Yes, it's not easy. Everything that happens requires special attention from the economic bloc of the government. On the whole, these efforts are having a positive effect,\" said Putin. Some background: In late April, Russia's Central Bank said the Russian economy was expected to shrink by 8-10% in 2022, noting a decline in economic activity in March after the imposition of international sanctions on Russia.  Earlier the same month, the World Bank predicted that Russian GDP would shrink by 11.2% in 2022.  Western sanctions imposed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine are making life difficult for the Kremlin, but they are also affecting the global economy. \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has compounded the Covid-19 pandemic – a crisis upon a crisis – devastating lives, dragging down growth and pushing up inflation,\" according to a blog from the International Monetary Fund published Monday. The United Nations' under secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs plans to visit Moscow in early June to discuss the situation in Ukraine, a spokesman for the Russian mission to the UN said Wednesday, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS.  Martin Griffiths plans to visit Moscow to \"continue dialogue he began during his previous visit to Moscow,\" and \"to discuss the entire spectrum of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine,\" spokesman Fyodor Strzhizhovsky said. Griffiths' previous visit to Moscow last month was an attempt to facilitate a \"humanitarian ceasefire,\" having been charged with meeting both parties in the conflict by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Strzhizhovsky added that the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Rebeca Grynspan will visit Moscow to discuss the export of Russian fertilizers. In recent months, the price of fertilizer -- an essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops -- has risen due to issues with exports from Russia. Output from Europe has also declined due to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. Norway's Yara -- one of the world's largest fertilizer makers -- has reduced export due to the surge in natural gas prices, cutting down the amount of ammonia and urea output from their plants in Italy and France. According to TASS, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said on Wednesday that the resolution of the food problem \"requires a comprehensive approach,\" calling for the lifting of sanctions on Russian exports and financial transactions. The Portuguese government has authorized the sale of Chelsea FC, the London football team owned by Roman Abramovich, a Russian businessman and Kremlin ally. Abramovich is subject to sanctions by the UK government and has seen his assets frozen. He put the club up for sale in early March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying at the time that it was \"in the best interest of the club.\" Abramovich has Portuguese citizenship and, due to sanctions, the government in Lisbon was required to approve the sale. \"Portuguese authorization is a result of the guarantee given by British authorities that proceeds from the sale will be used for humanitarian ends, without benefiting directly or indirectly the club owner, which is on the European Union sanctions list,\" the government said in a statement Wednesday evening. \"The national position has the assent of the European Union,\" the Portuguese executive added. The UK government has already permitted the sale, which will end Abramovich's almost two decades as owner of the club.  And on Tuesday the English Premier League announced that its board had approved the sale of the club. The deal, worth more than $5 billion, will see an ownership group led by Todd Boehly take control. Boehly has invested in a portfolio of sporting franchises, including stakes in the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks. \"Fierce battles\" are taking place around the strategically important city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. It comes as Russian forces intensify efforts to take full control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, parts of which have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.  Here's the latest on Russia's war in Ukraine: Battle for Severodonetsk: Russian shelling of the industrial city, which is key to controlling Luhansk, has increased \"exponentially,\" a top Ukrainian military official said Wednesday as Russian troops transfer from different regions to push through in the region \"at any cost.\" \"The next week is important,\" said Serhiy Haidai, head of the Luhansk military administration. \"If they do not succeed by Saturday or Sunday, they will run out of steam, and the situation will at least stabilize for us.\"\nRussian attacks in Donetsk: Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" on the key town of Lyman in the neighboring Donetsk region. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control there, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the southeast of the town become more at risk of encirclement. Food crisis: Russia is trying to \"blackmail\" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukraine's foreign minister said. He warned that if Moscow does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a \"multi-year food crisis.\"\nPutin's sweeteners: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Wednesday with soldiers wounded in Ukraine during a rare visit to a military hospital, according to footage released by the Kremlin. It comes as he announced that state pensions and the minimum wage will rise substantially in Russia from June 1 amid rising inflation.\nPassports for separatists: Also on Wednesday, Putin signed a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions occupied by Russian troops to obtain Russian citizenship. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemned the move. \nEU oil ban talks: European Council chief Charles Michel is \"confident\" that any issues over a proposed ban on Russian oil imports will be resolved by the next council meeting on May 30. \"We are working very hard in order to be able to stay united,\" he said. \nRallying call: Britain's foreign secretary will travel to Bosnia on Thursday, where she will use an address to the country's armed forces to urge the UK's Western partners to ensure Putin loses in Ukraine and warn against appeasing the Russian leader. ##Catch Up## Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has made a blistering attack on former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who suggested on Tuesday that peace negotiations should be aimed at creating borders along the \"line of contact\" in Donbas as it existed on the eve of the Russian invasion. Kissinger was speaking by video link to the Davos Forum.   In a video message Wednesday, Zelensky said, \"No matter what the Russian state does, there is someone who says: 'let's take into account its interests.' This year in Davos, it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians being killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the 'filtration camps' built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt.\n\"Russia has done all this in Europe. But still, in Davos, for example, Mr. Kissinger emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia.\" In his remarks, Kissinger said of the conflict that: "Negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome. Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante," apparently suggesting that Ukraine agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea. \"Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself,\" Kissinger said. Zelensky compared Kissinger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938. \"It seems that Mr. Kissinger's calendar is not 2022 but 1938, and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos but in what was then Munich,\" he said. \"By the way, in the real year 1938, when Mr. Kissinger's family was fleeing Nazi Germany, he was 15 years old.\" Zelensky called those who advise that Ukraine give something to Russia, the \"'great geo-politicians,' do not always want to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they are proposing to exchange for the illusion of peace. You always have to see people.\" Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned a move by Moscow that makes it easier for Ukrainians in some Russian-occupied regions to obtain Russian citizenship. \"Illegal passportization in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in Crimea and the temporarily occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, is a gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, norms and principles of international humanitarian law, and the obligations of Russia as an occupying power in accordance with Article 45 of the 1907 Hague Convention and Article 47 of the 1949 Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,\" the ministry said in a statement. \n\"The decree of the president of Russia is legally null and void and will have no legal consequences. This decision will not affect the citizenship of Ukrainians on the territories temporarily occupied by Russia.\" Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday streamlining the process for providing passports to Ukrainians in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  Russia has already handed out hundreds of thousands of passports to residents of separatist areas in Ukraine's east and in the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea, as well as to residents of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Transnistria in Moldova. Analysts say those moves have helped Moscow create a pretext for continued intervention in those areas.  Yevhen Yaroshenko, an analyst for the human rights organization Crimea SOS, said Russia's policy of \"passportization\" may also serve an agenda of providing conscripts for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   \"Shortly after obtaining a Russian passport, the Russian Federation may call up such a person for military service and subsequently involve him in combat operations against Ukraine,\" Yaroshenko said. \"Thus residents of the temporarily occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions become hostages of the call of the Russian Federation.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the launch of a new joint UK, EU and US group to help support efforts of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General (OPG) to document war crimes and other atrocities committed in Ukraine. The new mechanism, called the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), will "provide strategic advice and operational assistance to the War Crimes Units of the OPG, the legally constituted authority responsible for prosecuting war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,\" Blinken said.  \"Although the United States and our partners are supporting a range of international efforts to pursue accountability for atrocities, the OPG will play a crucial role in ensuring that those responsible for war crimes and other atrocities are held accountable.\"  He added the "ACA will liaise with the Department of Justice as it pursues accountability in US courts." In addition to streamlining efforts, the ACA will also provide expanded funding for the team of international prosecutors and other war crimes experts already deployed to the region, Blinken said. Earlier this week, a 21-year-old Russian soldier was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed man in Ukraine's first war crimes trial since Russia's invasion began. Russia is trying to "blackmail" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. This is \"clear blackmail,\" Kuleba claimed. \"You could not find a better example of blackmail in international relations.\"  He warned that if Russia does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a "multi-year food crisis." Some background: Before the war, Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest exporter of corn and fifth-largest exporter of wheat, according to the US State Department. Almost 30% of global trade in wheat came from Russia and Ukraine alone. Speaking at a panel discussion, Kuleba said Russia and Ukraine are nowhere near the possibility of negotiated peace and that Moscow has no intention of taking part in discussions aimed at ending the war.  "When you are conducting an operation like this, you basically say no to negotiations. If Russia had preferred talks to war, they would have behaved differently," he said.   Making concessions to Russia has not worked since 2014 and won't work now, Kuleba said.  "This strategy has been used by the leading global forces from 2014 to Feb. 24, 2022. Make concessions here, make concessions here, it will help prevent war. It has failed. Eight years of this strategy has resulted in missiles hitting Kyiv and bloodshed in Donbas,\" the foreign minister said.  Kuleba called again for further sanctions against Russia, namely stopping the purchase of Russian oil, which he said is keeping Moscow in a comfortable position. "Ukraine is suffering more than Russia is with the sanctions against it. ... After three months of war, my message is simple: kill Russian exports. Stop buying from Russia and allowing them to make money that they invest in the war machine to kill and destroy," he said.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has said that Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" in order to seize the key town of Lyman in the Donetsk region. Ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian efforts to \"completely take control\" of Lyman \"did not succeed.\" However, images posted on social media Wednesday showed Russian soldiers at identifiable locations in northern neighborhoods of the town, which Ukrainian forces have defended in the face of an intense assault since late April. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control over the town, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the southeast of Lyman become more at risk of encirclement. Motuzyanyk added, \"The enemy is conducting offensive operations, trying to surround our units near Lysychansk and Severodonetsk and reach the administrative border of Luhansk region.\" On Tuesday, the head of the regional administration in Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, described the situation in Lyman as \"very difficult.\" \"It's now under constant fire,\" he said. \"The enemy entered the territory of the Lyman community a long time ago. Their main goal is to take the center of the community of Lyman. The estuary is now partially under control, they enter, then they are kicked out, heavy artillery drives in, and tanks enter the outskirts of the city to conduct shelling and occupy the entire center and the entire Lyman community.\" The Institute for the Study of War reported in its latest assessment Tuesday that Russian forces continued to \"prioritize attacks against Lyman rather than Slovyansk on May 24, likely to support a shallow encirclement of Ukrainian troops northwest of Severodonetsk.\" European Council chief Charles Michel is \"confident\" that any issues over a proposed ban on Russian oil imports will be resolved by the next council meeting on May 30.  Addressing a news conference alongside Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm on Wednesday, Michel said that although he was \"still confident\" the bloc will be able to resolve any issues, it will require \"a lot of dialogue.\"  \"We are working very hard in order to be able to stay united,\" Michel stressed.  The Swedish prime minister publicly declared the country's desire \"to go further\" with sanctions against Russia.  The proposed ban has been largely opposed by Hungary, which has said that such a measure would be \"against Hungarian national energy security.\" "

    "body": "When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by video to a packed room at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he thanked the West for its solidarity against Russia. But he also issued a warning to political leaders and business executives: Don't lose your nerve.  \"I would only wish you not lose this feeling of unity,\" he said, calling again for maximum pressure on Moscow. Three months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leaders from Europe and the United States emphasize that they remain committed to sticking with unprecedented sanctions in an attempt to force President Vladimir Putin to pull its troops out.  But as the cost of food and fuel jumps — fanning political protests and public discontent around the world, and increasing the risk of a recession — maintaining a consensus could prove increasingly challenging. \"I am very worried about what a recession in Europe would do to European resolve to stick with it and continue to escalate the sanctions,\" Jason Furman, a Harvard professor who previously served as President Barack Obama's top economic adviser, told CNN Business. Already, cracks are starting to form in Europe's united front. Hungary's Viktor Orban, who was not present in Davos, has led dissenters in blocking the European Union's plans for an oil embargo on Russia, a bid to cut off a major source of revenue for Moscow. The goal of ultimately getting rid of Russian gas could prove even more difficult. In the United States, President Joe Biden and Democrats are under enormous pressure to prove they're serious about fighting inflation ahead of the midterm elections in November, even though most factors causing it, such as supply chain snarls and high consumer demand, are largely beyond their control. That could complicate efforts to continue to apply pressure on Russia, despite warnings from billionaire George Soros and others that appeasement of Putin would have catastrophic consequences.  Fuel and food prices shoot up At Davos, leaders from government and business stressed that they cannot capitulate to Putin. They agreed that the response to his annexation of Crimea in 2014, as well as the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England in 2018, was far too weak in hindsight. And the West's historic sanctions against Russia this year may not be enough, either. Russia's economy has been battered, but is holding up better than expected, bolstered in part by robust oil and gas revenues. That allowed the central bank to slash interest rates on Thursday. \"We have to stop compromising,\" Eduard Heger, the prime minister of Slovakia, said with emotion during a panel discussion. Compromising with Putin caused \"an aggressive war,\" he continued. Speaking to dinner guests, Soros warned that the invasion of Ukraine could mark the beginning of World War III, and said that Putin had to be defeated \"as soon as possible\" if the world wants to preserve civilization. But the economic backdrop could make life harder for politicians back home. Annual Inflation among the 19 countries that use the euro reached 7.4% in April, an all-time high. In the United States, inflation stood at 8.3%, and it hit 9% in the United Kingdom. A big factor is energy costs. They were already rising due to a supply and demand imbalance after the pandemic, but have been driven even higher by Europe's efforts to cut its dependence on Russian energy. An oil embargo has been held up by landlocked states like Hungary and the Czech Republic, which say they would need years to make the transition to other suppliers or energy sources. It is expected to be agreed in the coming weeks, however. \"The economic situation is definitely challenging. I don't think it's going to impact consensus on oil,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. Still, there will be consequences. Fears of energy shortages have already dramatically pushed up prices. In the United States, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline reached a record $4.60 on Thursday. The situation is even worse in Europe. Recent data shows drivers in the United Kingdom paying $8.06 per gallon, and $8.43 per gallon in Germany. At the same time, food prices are jumping as the war disrupts exports of key products such as wheat and sunflower oil, and as some countries like India subsequently enact export bans to protect domestic supplies. In April, food prices in Germany shot up 8.6% compared to the previous year. \"This is where the impact of the war in Ukraine is becoming more and more visible,\" Georg Thiel, president of Germany's Federal Statistical Office, said earlier this month. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted this week that \"it is fragile countries and vulnerable populations that suffer most.\" She added that bread prices have increased 70% in Lebanon, and food shipments from Ukraine's Odessa haven't been able to reach Somalia, which is battling a devastating drought. Protests over rising prices have broken out in Peru and led to the prime minister's ouster in Sri Lanka. However, even in Europe and the United States, lower-income households have increasingly been forced to choose between \"heating and eating,\" which account for a bigger proportion of their budgets. Economists worry that a pullback in spending could trigger recessions, especially as central banks raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. \"There's real risk for lots of people,\" Oxfam International Executive Director Gabriela Bucher told CNN Business. Even in the \"rich world,\" she added, there are people struggling \"to fulfill their basic needs at the moment.\" The British government acknowledged the problem Thursday when it announced a $6.3 billion windfall tax on oil companies to fund payments to people struggling with energy bills.  The future of Western solidarity American and European officials and top corporate brass say Ukraine's victory is crucial. The brutal war and humanitarian crisis must come to an end, and democratic values have to prevail at what Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz called a \"turning point\" for the world. \"It's hard to see any issue that has united people in the West as much as this issue,\" David Rubenstein, the billionaire founder of the Carlyle Group, told CNN Business. \"I don't think that the incremental increases that might be attributed to this with respect to inflation are going to change anybody's views.\" American officials also see standing up to Putin as imperative to curtailing the ambitions of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who they say is closely watching how the situation plays out. \"Deterrence is a key here,\" said US Congressman Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"As Xi looks at what's happening in Ukraine, [he's asking,] 'Is it worth it?' And we have to persuade him that it's not.\" But balancing politics and economic concerns won't be simple. Scholz conceded that \"politicians have an important task to attend to\" as they juggle different parts of their mandate from the public.  This could become a larger issue in the event of a major escalation by Russia, Rahman said. That could trigger louder calls for a full ban on Russian natural gas, which accounted for 45% of Europe's supplies last year. Much travels by pipeline, which makes it more difficult to find alternatives. That's not on the table right now, though Scholz said Germany is working \"flat out\" to end its reliance on Russian gas as soon as possible. But if it came under serious discussion, it would be a trickier sell than anything else the West has so far proposed. Companies, while telegraphing strong support for Ukraine, are also worried about growing pressure on their businesses. Herbert Diess, the CEO of Volkswagen, told CNN Business that the full effects of rising raw material costs and inflation wouldn't be apparent for another six or 12 months, creating a \"really tough\" operating environment. \"We should achieve something with sanctions,\" he said. \"So far, we're going basically from escalation to escalation and we have no choice. So I think sanctions, yes, but then how are we going to end this?\" Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State, sparked a backlash earlier this week when he appeared to suggest that Ukraine should agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea to Putin. \"Negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome,\" Kissinger said. \"Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante.\" Zelensky compared Kissinger's comments to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938.  \"I do not want to hear the word 'appeasement' anymore,\" European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said Wednesday, to applause. Still, a weakening economy and high inflation could weigh on politicians as they return home, sparking a warning from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \"Freedom is more important than free trade,\" Stoltenberg told the Davos crowd. \"The protection of our values is more important than profit.\"",

    "body": "Russia has spent the past half-century attempting to build a reputation on the world stage as a reliable supplier of energy. It took Vladimir Putin mere months to cast serious doubt on that reputation. \"I wouldn't trust them,\" US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN in response to a question about whether Russia will ever again be considered a reliable energy supplier. \"They have to prove they are a reliable partner and they're certainly not doing that.\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions from the West have sent oil prices skyrocketing, lifting gasoline and diesel prices in the United States to unprecedented levels. Natural gas prices also have  climbed around the world. After the West imposed tough penalties on Russia, Putin warned that \"unfriendly\" nations would need to pay for crucial Russian shipments of natural gas in rubles instead of euros. Following payment disputes, Russia has turned off the flow gas to Finland, Bulgaria and Poland. \"They are weaponizing energy, which is another reason why as a nation, we should move to energy sources that cannot be weaponized,\" Granholm said while speaking from a General Electric wind turbine testing facility in New Orleans on Tuesday. Of course, Russia could argue that the West is also weaponizing energy. The United States and other countries have banned imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal. Europe is debating similar steps.  Granholm: Wind and solar power can't be weaponized Although the war and inflation are drawing attention to the challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels, Granholm said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine only underscores the need to invest in clean energy. \"No country has ever been held hostage to access to the sun. No one has ever been held hostage to access to wind,\" Granholm said. \"We need to move to sources of energy that are not weaponized.\"  For now, though, the world economy is still very much reliant on fossil fuels. That reliance has prompted the Biden administration to aggressively drain oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to blunt the war-triggered price shock.  During a tour of an SPR site on Tuesday, Granholm questioned reserve officials about how the system works to respond to crises like the current one. US emergency stockpiles of oil are now at the lowest level since 1987. Open to building new refineries  The war has also drawn attention to another critical issue: America's shrinking refining capacity. Analysts have partially blamed the most recent spike in gas and diesel prices on the fact that US refineries can't keep up with strong demand, especially as more US petroleum products get shipped overseas because of war-related disruptions. The system also has lost firepower in recent years as several refineries have shut down or been converted to process cleaner sources of fuel. Refining capacity is down 5.5% over the past two years, according to the US Energy Information Administration.  Asked if she would support building a new refinery in the United States, Granholm told CNN, \"I would, actually.\" Granholm noted that since 2019, six refineries have closed in the United States and added that while new refineries would take years to have an impact, they could serve multiple purposes, including supplying sustainable aviation fuels.  \"We should look at all options that will help to increase supply,\" Granholm said, \"and refining right now is really a big bottleneck.\" No new refineries have been built in the United States in decades and questions about the future of fossil fuel use make such massive investments difficult, if not impossible.",

    "body": "America's economy shrank in the first quarter of the year at a slightly faster rate than initially reported, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday.  US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, decreased at an annualized rate of 1.5% between January and March, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to the second estimate of the data. Some economists fear this could mean the nation might be headed for another recession, commonly defined as two quarters of declines in GDP. Last month, the Commerce Department's advance estimate of the data showed GDP had contracted at a rate of 1.4%. Economists had expected Thursday's revisions to improve slightly, with a decline of 1.3%. The update was driven by revisions to private inventory and residential investments, even as consumer spending was revised higher. However, higher imports to feed continued strong demand were a drag on GDP in the first months of the year. Core inflation, measured through the price index tracking personal consumption expenditures minus food and energy costs, was revised down to 5.1% from 5.2% in the initial report. Is a recession looming? No matter the update, the message remains the same: The US economy witnessed a sharp slowdown in the first months of the year, compared with the 6.9% growth rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. It also marked the worst quarter since the pandemic recession in the second quarter of 2020. Inflation at a 40-year high, ongoing supply chain issues exacerbated by Covid lockdowns in Asia, and the war in Ukraine are all weighing on food and energy markets, hoisting red flags for the economic outlook. US economic growth relies heavily on consumer spending. Economists and business leaders have worried for months that there will be a point at which prices have risen so high that consumers will start dramatically cutting back. And that would be very bad news for growth. That said, a recession is no done deal either. \"The US economy remains strong approaching mid-year, but cracks are starting to appear in the foundation,\" said Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"We anticipate strong consumer spending activity and resilient business investment growth through the summer, but high inflation, rising interest rates and depressed financial markets will no doubt weigh on sentiment and demand as we approach year-end.\" In a new report, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that GDP will reach 3.1% in 2022, with elevated inflation persisting through the end of the year. \"In CBO's projections, the current economic expansion continues, and economic output grows rapidly over the next year,\" according to its latest government forecast, released Wednesday. The Federal Reserve has embarked on a series of interest rate hikes as it tries to engineer a \"soft landing\" -- tightening monetary policy from the accommodative stance it took during the height of the pandemic without pushing the economy off a cliff. On Wednesday, minutes from the Fed's early May policy meeting revealed that central bank officials expect solid GDP growth in the current, second quarter of the year, rather than another contraction.",

    "body": "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said President Joe Biden is laser-focused on knocking down sky-high gasoline prices, though she concedes that even the most powerful person on the planet has limited influence to do that. \"He's obsessed with the fact that gas prices are so high and people are hurting,\" Granholm told CNN on Tuesday following a rare tour of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's emergency oil stockpile.  Granholm argued that by unleashing record amounts of emergency oil to ease strains caused by the war in Ukraine, Biden has already used the \"biggest tool\" at his disposal to address energy crises.  \"The president doesn't control the price,\" the former governor of Michigan said during the interview at a General Electric wind turbine facility in New Orleans.  Granholm was speaking hours after touring Bayou Choctaw, one of the SPR's four major oil storage sites. Located nearly 100 miles west of New Orleans, the heavily-fortified Louisiana facility is the busiest it's been since its 1987 opening as officials race to get emergency barrels to market.  Flanked by state and local officials, Granholm received a briefing on Tuesday from SPR staffers about how the system responds to supply crunches like the current one.  Encircled by barbed wire fences and protected by electronic alarm systems and security dogs, the facility features a maze of pipes and sophisticated high-pressure pumps used to either inject, or more recently, extract oil stored deep underground. The oil is kept in caverns located 2,000-feet below the surface inside salt domes. The caverns are massive — deep enough to stack the Washington Monument four times — and each holds about 10 million barrels of crude oil.  'Everything is still on the table' The steady march higher in pump prices — the national average hit a record high of $4.60 a gallon on Wednesday, up 51% from a year ago — is forcing US officials to contemplate even more intervention. Asked if the Biden administration is seriously considering additional action, such as banning US oil exports, Granholm said: \"Everything is still on the table.\" However, some industry experts have warned a ban on shipments of US crude abroad would only inflate world oil prices, which are what pump prices are based on.  Granholm added that Biden's advisers are \"pressure-testing\" a series of moves to make sure there are no unintended consequences.  'Mind-blowing'  Gas prices initially retreated after Biden announced a record-setting release of 180 million barrels of oil from the SPR in late March following the disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The relief proved to be temporary, however, and today the national average price per gallon is 37 cents higher than it was on the day Biden announced the unprecedented step. Granholm defended the SPR strategy, saying it is an effort to get supply to meet demand and that other global events are also influencing prices, including the war in Ukraine and China's Covid lockdowns. The Biden administration is now releasing so much emergency oil, on top of Congressionally-mandated sales to raise revenue, that some in the energy industry doubted the SPR could even pump out that much crude all at once.  Yet SPR officials said the system has been able to handle the drawdowns with minimal issues, although the reserve now holds the lowest amount of oil since 1987. \"It's kind of mind-blowing we are able to do it,\" Paul Oosterling, project manager at the SPR Office of Project Management, told reporters.  Technically, the SPR could supply even more oil: the system has a maximum drawdown capacity of 4.2 million barrels per day.  Climate ambition meets economic reality Biden ran on the most aggressive climate agenda of anyone ever elected president. Yet he is now draining oil from the SPR at a record pace, urging US oil and gas companies to pump more oil and trying to persuade OPEC to add supply.  Asked if this is an awkward juxtaposition, Granholm replied, \"he's  responding to the current situation.\" \"You can walk and chew gum. You can do both,\" Granholm said. \"The fact that we are paying these outrageous prices is almost an exclamation point on the fact that we need to move to clean energy so we are not in this position in the future.\" The gas price spike is squeezing families, forcing them to make difficult decisions about their finances.  \"The people who are hurt the most are the people who have the least,\" Democratic Congressman Troy Carter, Sr. told CNN on Tuesday after touring the SPR.  Carter, whose district includes New Orleans, said it's easy to Monday-morning quarterback the administration, but he is pleased with what they've done so far to combat high gas prices. \"As it stands today, I think the White House is doing as much as they can given the circumstances,\" he said. \"We continue to push to have them do more.\" Granholm: Big Oil is putting profit ahead of citizens After taking office, Biden wasted no time in focusing on the climate crisis. On his first day in office, he signed executive orders revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, imposing a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic and putting the United States on track to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement.  Now, Biden officials are openly pleading with Big Oil to pump more, not less. \"We want them to get their rig counts up. We want them to increase production so that people are not hurting,\" Granholm said. After losing gobs of money in 2020 when oil prices crashed, the industry is now minting cash and returning billions to investors in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Even so, US oil production remains significantly below pre-Covid levels.  \"They are prioritizing profit for their shareholders over helping their citizens,\" Granholm said, adding that some companies are starting to ramp up production and US output is on track to hit record highs next year. \"It is extremely frustrating to see that there's not a full-on return to production at the moment of crisis.\"",

    "body": "The gunman who killed 19 students and two teachers at a Texas elementary school Tuesday was on the premises for up to an hour before law enforcement forcibly entered a classroom and killed him, officials said Wednesday. \"It's going to be within, like 40 minutes or something, (within) an hour,\" Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw told CNN's Ed Lavandera at a news conference. The 18-year-old shooter, Salvador Ramos, was in a standoff with law enforcement officers for about a half-hour after firing on students and teachers, Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose district includes Uvalde, told CNN's Jake Tapper, citing a briefing he was given. \"And then (the shooting) stops, and he barricades himself in. That's where there's kind of a lull in the action,\" Gonzales said. \"All of it, I understand, lasted about an hour, but this is where there's kind of a 30-minute lull. They feel as if they've got him barricaded in. The rest of the students in the school are now leaving.\" Raul Ortiz, Chief of the US Border Patrol, told CNN that agents arrived at the scene after police officers engaged the suspect at the school. Several members of the Border Patrol tactical team, a search and rescue responder and a few other agents joined local officers to form a team that went after the gunman. \"They didn't hesitate. They came up with a plan. They entered that classroom and they took care of the situation as quickly as they possibly could,\" Ortiz told. That ended the second deadliest shooting at a K-12 school in the United States since 2012, when 26 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It was at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in 2022, according to a CNN tally. LIVE UPDATES: Deadly shooting at Texas elementary school The gunman was a local high school dropout with no criminal history and no known mental health history, officials said. He had just turned 18 and legally bought two AR-15-style rifles and ammunition for his birthday. His grandfather said Wednesday he didn't know Ramos had guns. \"If I had known I would have reported him,\" Rolando Reyes said. Gunman allegedly texted teenaged girl in Germany on day of shooting The gunman allegedly texted a girl who lives in Germany about his intentions just before he shot his grandmother in her home and left for the school in her pickup. According to screenshots reviewed by CNN and an interview with the 15-year-old girl -- who said she had been in contact with the gunman for weeks -- Salvador Ramos complained about his grandmother being \"on the phone with AT&T abojt (sic) my phone.\" \"It's annoying,\" he texted.  Six minutes later, he texted: \"I just shot my grandma in her head.\" Seconds after that, he said, \"Ima go shoot up a(n) elementary school rn (right now).\" The last message was sent at 6:21 p.m. Central European Time, which was 11:21 a.m. in Texas.  The girl, who lives in Frankfurt, said she began chatting with Ramos on a social media app on May 9. Ramos sent the girl selfie videos and discussed a plan to go visit her in Europe, according to videos and text messages. The girl, whose mother gave permission for her to be interviewed, said she spoke to Ramos daily on FaceTime. She said she also communicated with him via a social livestreaming app called Yubo and played games with him on a gaming app named Plato. In their conversations, she said he asked about her life in Germany. \"He looked happy and comfortable talking to me,\" the girl said.  The texts to the girl are similar to messages that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Ramos wrote on Facebook. Those disturbing writings, Abbott said, came as the suspect indeed shot his grandmother, drove to nearby Robb Elementary School, forced his way inside adjoining classrooms and opened fire at a group of kids and faculty. Officers eventually forced their way into the barricaded room and a Border Patrol officer fatally shot him, Abbott said. A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, said the gunman's messages were made in private one-to-one texts that were discovered after the shooting. Now, the city of Uvalde, about 90 miles west of San Antonio and just east of the US-Mexico border, finds itself on the long list of American communities devastated by mass shootings. So far, seven 10-year-olds and a two fourth-grade teachers have been named publicly by relatives as among the dead. Parents waited late into Tuesday night at a civic center to learn whether their children had survived, some having given DNA to help authorities identify victims, they told CNN. Authorities have since identified all the victims, whose remains have been removed from the murder scene, and notified their families, Texas Department of Public Safety Lt. Chris Olivarez said. President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will visit Uvalde soon.   \"As a nation, I think we all must be there for them,\" Biden said. \"And we must ask when in God's name will we do what needs to be done to if not completely stop, fundamentally change the amount of the carnage that goes on in this country.\" So far, there have been more mass shootings than days in 2022 -- including the racist attack at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store a little over a week ago that left 10 dead. At least 213 mass shootings had been recorded this year as of Tuesday, the 144th day of the year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. CNN and the archive each define a mass shooting as one in which four or more people were injured or killed, not including the shooter.   Sympathy also poured in from across the globe, including Pope Francis, who pushed for stronger gun control. Leaders of France, Germany and Spain shared condolences, too, along with the President of war-torn Ukraine, who called it \"terrible to have victims of shooters in peaceful time.\" How the shooting unfolded The gunman shot his grandmother in the face before driving to Robb Elementary, a second through fourth grade school, to carry out the attack, Gov. Abbott said. Officials said the grandmother, who called 911, remains in a hospital -- as do five victims from the school -- but was upgraded from critical condition to serious on Wednesday. Soon after that initial shooting, police got a 911 call about a vehicle that had crashed near the school and someone armed with a rifle heading inside, Olivarez told CNN in an interview Wednesday morning. The man was wearing a \"tactical vest carrier with no ballistic panels,\" Olivarez said. Sgt. Erick Estrada of the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN that when the shooter got to the school, he encountered a school resource officer, dropped a black bag with ammunition inside and entered the school. The shooter barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms and opened fire on the children and two teachers, Olivarez said, calling the act \"complete evil.\" With the shooter barricaded inside, officers were at a disadvantage, he said. \"There was not sufficient manpower at that time, and their primary focus was to preserve any further loss of life,\" he told CNN. \"They started breaking windows around the school and trying to rescue, evacuate children and teachers while that was going on.\" A tactical team of local and federal officers arrived, forced its way into the classroom and shot the gunman dead, Olivarez said.  Community shattered by sudden tragedy As the last day of school was drawing near, Robb Elementary students were celebrating with special themed dress days, including Tuesday's theme of \"Footloose and Fancy.\" Students were encouraged to come dressed in nice outfits and show off their fun footwear, according to a post on the school's Facebook page.  But by Tuesday afternoon, shaken students were being bused to the civic center-turned-reunification site. As the evening stretched on, some parents began to learn their young children had not survived. \"We see people coming out just terrorized. They're crying one by one. They're being told that their child has passed on,\" state Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN on Tuesday night from the site.  As news of the shooting broke in Uvalde, Robb Elementary parents were told students were being taken to the SSGT Willie de Leon Civic Center, according to a post on the school district's Facebook page. The site quickly became the epicenter for families looking for their children, and scenes of devastation began to play out as victims were identified.  Parents were asked for DNA swabs to confirm their relationships to their children and instructed to wait an hour for an answer, at least four families told CNN. 'She just wanted to save everyone,' father says  Seven of the children and two teachers killed have been identified publicly by their families.  Angel Garza, the father of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza,  told CNN's Anderson Cooper his daughter was trying to help her classmates. \"She was trying to do the right thing,\" he said. \"She was just trying to call the cops, that's all.\" He later added, \"I just want people to know she died trying to save her classmates. She just wanted to save everyone.\" Garza, who works as a med aide, arrived at the scene to help victims and said he learned his daughter had died as he checked on a survivor who was covered in blood. \"She was hysterical saying they shot her best friend,\" he said. \"'She's not breathing, and she tried to call the cops.' I asked her what's her name and she said, she told me 'Amerie, she said Amerie.'\" Teacher Irma Garcia was identified through a GoFundMe campaign. She was a wife and mother to four children, according to the campaign. \"Sweet, kind, loving. Fun with the greatest personality. A wonderful 4th grade teacher at Robb Elementary that was a victim in a Texas school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. She sacrificed herself protecting the kids in her classroom. She was a hero. She was loved by many and will truly be missed,\" the campaign said. Garcia was in her fifth year co-teaching with Eva Mireles, whose aunt confirmed her death. Mireles had been an educator for 17 years and in her off time enjoyed running, hiking, biking and spending time with her family, according to her profile on the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District website. Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez, a 10-year-old third grader, was killed in the same classroom as her cousin, who was also died, relatives told CNN affiliate KHOU. The cousin's name has not been released. Ten-year-old Xavier Lopez's mother confirmed her son was killed and recalled her fourth grader's unforgettable smile. Xavier was days away from finishing elementary school and \"couldn't wait\" to attend middle school, his mother told the Washington Post. Martinez had been at the school earlier Tuesday to cheer on Xavier during the honor roll ceremony, at which he got a certificate. She took a picture of her boy and told him she was proud of him and loved him, she said. Then, she hugged her \"mama's boy\" goodbye.  Jose Flores Jr., 10, was killed, as we",

    "body": "The deepening chasm between the crypto evangelists and naysayers may never have been as stark. On Wednesday, Andreessen Horowitz, the most prominent Silicon Valley venture capital group, made a $4.5 billion bet on what it called a \"golden era\" for cryptocurrencies, citing \"a massive wave of world-class talent\" that's entered the industry in the past year.  \"That's why we decided to go big,\" wrote Chris Dixon, a managing partner at the firm. On the same day, a once-bullish investor made headlines predicting bitcoin could fall to $8,000 from its current level of around $30,000. \"Bitcoin and any cryptocurrency at this point has not really established itself as a credible institutional investment,\" Scott Minerd, Guggenheim Partners' chief investment officer, told Bloomberg News at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \"It's really become the market of a bunch of yahoos and backwaters.\" That's quite a shift since February last year, when Minerd told CNN's Julia Chatterly that he could see bitcoin, which at the time was trading around $40,000, eventually soar to as much as \"$400,000 to $600,000.\"  Bitcoin hit its peak of $69,000 in November. It's lost more than half its value since then as investors have pulled out of riskier assets in the face of rising interest rates.  Despite the crash, there were several panels about cryptocurrencies and digital money at Davos this year, not to mention a spate of crypto-linked vendors along the town's famed promenade. But establishment voices at the summit didn't waste any time disparaging the web3 crowd. \"Bitcoin may be called a coin but it's not money,\" said Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on Day One of the event. \"It's not a stable store of value.\"   So where do we go from here? It's easy to watch crypto's day to day volatility, as well as fringe projects like Terra and Luna enter a \"death spiral,\" and dismiss the blockchain technology and philosophy underpinning them. But the crypto faithful say that despite its problems, crypto isn't going away. For one thing, according to some experts, crypto has to confront its branding problem. The term cryptocurrency can be misleading, Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset brokerage GlobalBlock, told me. \"Ninety-nine percent of cryptocurrencies aren't trying to be currencies — they're trying to be assets behind these blockchain networks,\" he said. \"And I think that it's only a matter of time before all businesses integrate blockchain in some form of way.\" Calls are growing for closer regulation, especially after the collapse of TerraUSD and its sister coin, Luna, earlier this month. Many advocates support greater oversight, in part because it could help cryptos gain mainstream credibility. There are an estimated 300 million crypto users currently, and Sotiriou says the number is doubling every year — nearly twice the historical rate of internet adoption.  \"Even though sentiment is very, very negative at the moment and it all seems all doom and gloom,\" he says, \"the actual fundamentals of crypto haven't changed.\" Davos Dispatch Here's Julia Horowitz, the lead writer of Before the Bell, with a dispatch from Davos, Switzerland, where she's reporting on the World Economic Forum. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, has a message for tech giants SAP and Cloudflare: Get out of Russia, now. I spoke to Fedorov on the sidelines of the Davos summit — the first place he's visited outside Ukraine since Russia invaded three months ago. He was here on a mission to urge business and government leaders to do more to help, and met with leaders from Google, Microsoft and Facebook's Meta. \"Each of us can do even better,\" he said. Almost 500 tech companies have left Russia since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, by Fedorov's count. But he called out tech firms Cloudflare and SAP for continuing to operate in Russia, which he said undermines the effectiveness of the \"digital blockade.\" \"When a company is working in the Russian market, it pumps funds into the Russian budget from which money gets to the Russian army,\" Fedorov said. \"This enables killing Ukrainians.\"  Germany's SAP, which makes business software, said in April it planned to exit Russia. But Fedorov said the company is slow-walking its departure and needs to move faster. \"I'm convinced eventually they will leave Russia, sooner or later — but sooner [is better] than later, because people are getting killed,\" he said. SAP said in a statement that it's having \"an ongoing dialogue with the Ukrainian government, which included conversations at Davos,\" and that it \"has stood in solidarity with the Ukrainians since the start of Russia's unjustified war.\"  Cloudflare, meanwhile, has said it is still operating in Russia to protect the flow of uncensored information to Russians. \"They say they allegedly are there to defend some kind of democracy,\" Fedorov said. In a statement, the cloud services operator said it \"has minimal sales and commercial activity in Russia\" and has \"terminated any customers we have identified as tied to sanctioned entities.\"  Fedorov emphasized that a \"digital blockade\" is an important tool to fight back against Russia, since it can set the country back \"two or three decades,\" encouraging engineers and other specialists to leave.  \"We also want people in Russia to understand that 'Guys, something is wrong.' And they have to stand up against war,\" Fedorov added. China's leaders are signaling panic In an unusual move, China's cabinet convened an emergency meeting with more than 100,000 participants on Wednesday, according to state media. The agenda: Do whatever it takes to save the economy.  During the unexpected video teleconference, Premier Li Keqiang offered what is perhaps the grimmest assessment yet of the state of the economy from China's leadership. Li said that in some ways it is in worse shape than it was in 2020, during the initial outbreak of coronavirus, my CNN Business colleague Jessie Yeung writes. He urged leaders across the country to reverse rising unemployment. Step back: The world's second-largest economy, which once regularly boasted growth rates of 10% or more, has suffered under its own Covid-19 protocol, which is keeping millions of people under lockdown.  Earlier this week, UBS lowered its full-year GDP growth forecast to 3%. China has said it expects growth of around 5.5% this year.  Sustained growth isn't merely an economic priority. China's party leadership have maintained their grip on power in part by engineering growth that has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty. Leaders are especially sensitive to signs of social unrest that could result from diminishing economic prospects.  Earlier this month, Li, the No. 2 figure in the Communist Party after President Xi Jinping, described the country's economic conditions as \"complex and grave.\" Despite the hardships, President Xi has only doubled down on the zero-Covid policy, saying the state would punish anyone who questions it.",

In meetings with Meta and Google, Fedorov said he discussed countering disinformation, blocking propaganda channels and creating \"a green corridor\" for information from Ukrainian media outlets and bloggers so it doesn't get blocked. Ukraine's digital ministry also continues to push for direct donations to support the defense and reconstruction of the country. At Ukraine House, the delegation's hub in Davos, visitors can contribute via credit card, bank transfer or PayPal, or with cryptocurrency.  On Wednesday, Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian winner of this year's Eurovision song contest, announced that it was raffling off its trophy to the highest bidder to raise money for Ukraine's military. Bids can be made in crypto. The recent rout in crypto markets has hurt the Ukrainian government's fundraising efforts. Fedorov said that a few weeks ago, the government had brought in about $70 million in crypto. Now, that number is between $60 million and $65 million, he estimated.",

    "body": "Russia slashed interest rates on Thursday as a resurgent ruble — buoyed by robust oil and gas revenues and government support — takes some pressure off its wobbling economy.  At an extraordinary meeting, the Russian central bank cut interest rates to 11% from 14% and said further reductions could follow. Rates were hiked as high as 20% in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February as the bank tried to prevent Western sanctions triggering a financial crisis.  \"Inflationary pressure eases on the back of the ruble exchange rate dynamics as well as the noticeable decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses,\" the Russian central bank said in a statement. It said it expected inflation to fall to between 5% and 7% this year, down from around 17.5% this month.  The ruble crashed to a record low of about 135 to the US dollar in the wake of the invasion as the West froze about half of Russia's $600 billion foreign currency reserves. Hundreds of multinationals have quit the country, and Russia has been banned from buying key Western technology and services.  But Russia's currency has since rebounded and is the world's best performer this year, according to Reuters, propped up by capital controls aimed at forcing businesses and investors to buy rubles, and soaring global energy prices. One US dollar now buys about 62 rubles. Western efforts to curtail Russian energy imports have been slow-moving, and surging oil and gas prices have boosted the Kremlin's coffers. \"The key point is that high oil and gas revenues are providing policymakers with a lifeline, allowing them to row back emergency economic measures,\" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.  \"Against that backdrop, a further easing of capital controls and additional rate cuts seem likely,\" he added.  Russian President Vladimir Putin spent years leading up to the war trying to build a \"fortress economy,\" accumulating reserves that could be deployed in the event of an emergency. On Wednesday, he announced a 10% increase in pensions and the minimum wage to help protect Russians from the impact of inflation. But Russia's economy is hardly on a solid footing. Capital controls and emergency reserves can last only so long. And new US restrictions mean Russia could soon default on its foreign debt for the first time in more than a century. Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, said Putin was now having to deploy those emergency buffers, and that the rate cut was part of a public relations campaign.  'Info war' \"They are in an info war with the west, the ruble's part of that,\" he told CNN Business.  A deep recession is coming this year. The International Monetary Fund expects Russian GDP to contract by 8.5%, as a consequence of the harsh sanctions imposed on Moscow.  Still, those sanctions have yet to strike deep at the heart of Russia's fossil fuel resources. Moscow is finding it harder to sell its oil and coal, but its biggest energy customer — the European Union — still can't agree on an oil embargo and an outright ban on Russian natural gas imports isn't even on the table.  Russia is now trimming forecasts for the decline in its oil production this year. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said oil output could fall to between 480 million and 500 million tonnes, down about 6.5% on 2021, state news agency RIA reported Thursday. Russia's economy ministry had previously forecast a drop of about 9.3% this year.  \"I think the contraction will be way smaller,\" Novak was quoted as telling reporters on a visit to Iran. \"There was only one month with contraction of more than 1 million barrels per day, which is not as deep by now. So, I think there will be a recovery in the future,\" he added. While many Western traders and refineries have been shunning Russian oil and coal, India and China have moved in to pick up some of the slack.  — Reuters contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has made a blistering attack on former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who suggested on Tuesday that peace negotiations should be aimed at creating borders along the \"line of contact\" in Donbas as it existed on the eve of the Russian invasion. Kissinger was speaking by video link to the Davos Forum.   In a video message Wednesday, Zelensky said, \"No matter what the Russian state does, there is someone who says: 'let's take into account its interests.' This year in Davos, it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians being killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the 'filtration camps' built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt.\n\"Russia has done all this in Europe. But still, in Davos, for example, Mr. Kissinger emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia.\" In his remarks, Kissinger said of the conflict that: "Negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome. Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante," apparently suggesting that Ukraine agree to give up much of the Donbas and Crimea. \"Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself,\" Kissinger said. Zelensky compared Kissinger's views to appeasement of Nazi Germany in 1938. \"It seems that Mr. Kissinger's calendar is not 2022 but 1938, and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos but in what was then Munich,\" he said. \"By the way, in the real year 1938, when Mr. Kissinger's family was fleeing Nazi Germany, he was 15 years old.\" Zelensky called those who advise that Ukraine give something to Russia, the \"'great geo-politicians,' do not always want to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they are proposing to exchange for the illusion of peace. You always have to see people.\" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is traveling to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Thursday, where she will use an address to the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to urge the UK's Western partners to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin loses in Ukraine, the Foreign Office said in a statement late Wednesday. Truss will also warn against appeasing the Russian leader, the release added. "Russia's aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength", she will say according to the Foreign Office. "We must be relentless in ensuring Ukraine prevails through military aid and sanctions. We can't take our foot off the accelerator now.\" President Vladimir Putin has announced that state pensions and the minimum wage will rise substantially in Russia from June 1. According to the state news agency TASS, Putin made the announcement at a meeting of the State Council. \"We discussed this issue with the government for a long time, there were differences within the government and a solution was worked out,\" he said according to TASS. "I propose to increase the pensions of non-working pensioners by 10% from June 1.\" \"Our main task is to ensure [a] further increase in the minimum wage, so that the citizens' income level would significantly exceed the size of the subsistence rate,\" he added. Some background: Pensions were raised by 8.6% at the beginning of the year, but inflation has risen sharply this year. Putin said it was currently 17.5% but would decline to 15% by the end of the year. However, he denied that the spike in inflation was related to the conflict in Ukraine. \"The current year is not easy. Since its beginning, cumulative inflation has exceeded 11%. But when I say 'not easy' this does not mean at all that all these difficulties are associated with this special military operation, because in countries that do not conduct any operations, say, across the ocean, in North America, in Europe, inflation is comparable. And if you look at the structure of their economy — it's even more than ours, and in some neighboring countries, it's many times higher,\" Putin said. Prince Charles has paid a visit to a Ukrainian refugee center in Romania, according to a news release from Clarence House. Prince Charles joined Her Majesty Margareta, custodian of Romanian Crown, in "the visit to the Romexpo Donation Center for Ukrainian refugees in Bucharest, to see at first hand the excellent response of the Romanian authorities and of international and local organizations to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine," according to the news release.  As part of the visit, they spoke to "Ukrainians who have fled the horrors of war in Ukraine," Clarence House said. The center has been seeing a "steady increase" in the number of Ukrainian refugees it has welcomed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Clarence House said. Romania has welcomed one of the highest numbers of Ukrainian refugees in Europe, according to data from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). As of May 24, 972,203 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Romania, according to the latest UNHCR update. This latest visit from Prince Charles "follows a series of engagements" undertaken "in recent months in support of the Ukrainian community," according to the news release. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned a move by Moscow that makes it easier for Ukrainians in some Russian-occupied regions to obtain Russian citizenship. \"Illegal passportization in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in Crimea and the temporarily occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, is a gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, norms and principles of international humanitarian law, and the obligations of Russia as an occupying power in accordance with Article 45 of the 1907 Hague Convention and Article 47 of the 1949 Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"The decree of the president of Russia is legally null and void and will have no legal consequences. This decision will not affect the citizenship of Ukrainians on the territories temporarily occupied by Russia.\" Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Wednesday streamlining the process for providing passports to Ukrainians in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia has already handed out hundreds of thousands of passports to residents of separatist areas in Ukraine's east and in the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea, as well as to residents of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Transnistria in Moldova. Analysts say those moves have helped Moscow create a pretext for continued intervention in those areas.  Yevhen Yaroshenko, an analyst for the human rights organization Crimea SOS, said Russia's policy of \"passportization\" may also serve an agenda of providing conscripts for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   \"Shortly after obtaining a Russian passport, the Russian Federation may call up such a person for military service and subsequently involve him in combat operations against Ukraine,\" said Yaroshenko. \"Thus residents of the temporarily occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions become hostages of the call of the Russian Federation.\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the launch of a new joint UK, EU and US group to help support efforts of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General (OPG) to document war crimes and other atrocities committed in Ukraine. The new mechanism, called the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), will "provide strategic advice and operational assistance to the War Crimes Units of the OPG, the legally constituted authority responsible for prosecuting war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,\" Blinken said. \"Although the United States and our partners are supporting a range of international efforts to pursue accountability for atrocities, the OPG will play a crucial role in ensuring that those responsible for war crimes and other atrocities are held accountable.\"  He added that the "ACA will liaise with the Department of Justice as it pursues accountability in US courts." In addition to streamlining efforts, the ACA will also provide expanded funding for the team of international prosecutors and other war crimes experts already deployed to the region, Blinken said. Earlier this week, a 21-year-old Russian soldier was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed man in Ukraine's first war crimes trial since Russia's invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin met Wednesday with soldiers wounded in fighting in Ukraine during a rare visit to a military hospital, according to footage released by the Kremlin.  Putin visited the Mandryk Central Military Clinical Hospital of the Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow and \"spoke with members of the Russian Armed Forces undergoing treatment after being wounded during the special military operation, as well as with the hospital's medical personnel,\" according to the Kremlin.  Putin, wearing a medical gown, asked the servicemen how they felt, where they were from and how their families were doing, the video showed.  Putin was accompanied by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. On Wednesday, Putin also visited the National Crisis Management Center of the Ministry of Emergencies, according to the Kremlin.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday the president \"constantly takes interest in and keeps under his control the topic of conditions provided for those wounded in the course of the special military operation,\" according to Russian state news agency TASS. The Swiss government plans to seize more than 100 million Swiss francs ($104 million) worth of assets from an associate of Ukraine's former president, Viktor Yanukovych, who was deposed in 2014, it said on Wednesday. The proceedings concern assets of Yuriy Ivanyushchenko and his family that were frozen after Ukraine's 2014 revolution, the Swiss government said in a statement, stressing the move was "unrelated to sanctions" that Switzerland imposed against Russians this year. The finance ministry will now ask the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland to approve confiscating the assets so that they can be returned to Ukraine, the government said. A few days after Yanukovych's ouster, the Swiss cabinet had ordered the freezing of any assets in Switzerland of the deposed president and his entourage, including Ivanyushchenko, a former member of parliament whom it described as a close confidant of the former leader. However, Ukrainian authorities have not been able to issue judgements ordering the confiscation of those assets, according to the Swiss government. The Swiss government said since the war in Ukraine "severely compounded" criminal proceedings against Ivanyushchenko, it now considers confiscation proceedings in Switzerland "both possible and appropriate." Regional officials in Ukraine say that two people have been killed by Russian shelling of the town of Balakliya, which is on the frontlines in the Kharkiv region. Nataliya Popova, an adviser to the head of the Regional Council in Kharkiv, said seven people had been injured in the shelling Wednesday, including one child who is in critical condition. Balakliya lies to the northwest of Izium, which is occupied by Russian forces and has become their platform for attacks further south into Donetsk region. Russia is trying to "blackmail" the international community with an offer to unblock Ukrainian sea ports if sanctions against it are lessened, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. This is "clear blackmail,\" Kuleba claimed. \"You could not find a better example of blackmail in international relations."  He warned that if Russia does not lift its blockage of Ukrainian exports of crops, the entire agricultural cycle will be interrupted and could spur a "multi-year food crisis." Some background: Before the war, Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest exporter of corn and fifth-largest exporter of wheat, according to the US State Department. Almost 30% of global trade in wheat came from Russia and Ukraine alone. Speaking at a panel discussion, Kuleba said Russia and Ukraine are nowhere near the possibility of negotiated peace and that Russia has no intention of taking part in discussions aimed at ending the war.  "When you are conducting an operation like this, you basically say no to negotiations. If Russia had preferred talks to war, they would have behaved differently," he said.   Making concessions to Russia has not worked since 2014 and won't work now, Kuleba said.  "This strategy has been used by the leading global forces from 2014 to Feb. 24, 2022. Make concessions here, make concessions here, it will help prevent war. It has failed. Eight years of this strategy has resulted in missiles hitting Kyiv and bloodshed in Donbas,\" the foreign minister said.  Kuleba called again for further sanctions against Russia, namely stopping the purchase of Russian oil, which he said is keeping Moscow in a comfortable position. "Ukraine is suffering more than Russia is with the sanctions against it. ... After three months of war, my message is simple: kill Russian exports. Stop buying from Russia and allowing them to make money that they invest in the war machine to kill and destroy," he said.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has said that Russian forces are \"conducting an intense offensive\" in order to seize the key town of Lyman in the Donetsk region. Ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian efforts to \"completely take control\" of Lyman \"did not succeed.\" However, images posted on social media Wednesday showed Russian soldiers at identifiable locations in northern neighborhoods of the town, which Ukrainian forces have defended in the face of an intense assault since late April. Lyman is an important rail hub, and if the Russians are able to consolidate control over the town, the nearby city of Sloviansk becomes more vulnerable to attack by artillery — and Ukrainian troops to the south-east of Lyman become more at risk of encirclement. Motuzyanyk added, \"The enemy is conducting offensive operations, trying to surround our units near Lysychansk and Severodonetsk and reach the administrative border of Luhansk region.\" On Tuesday, the head of the regional administration in Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko, described the situation in Lyman as \"very difficult.\" \"It's now under constant fire,\" he said. \"The enemy entered the territory of the Lyman community a long time ago. Their main goal is to take the centre of the community of Lyman. The estuary is now partially under control, they enter, then they are kicked out, heavy artillery drives in, and tanks enter the outskirts of the city to conduct shelling and occupy the entire center and the entire Lyman community.\" The Institute for the Study of War reported in its latest assessment Tuesday that Russian forces continued to \"prioritize attacks against Lyman rather than Slovyansk on May 24, likely to support a shallow encirclement of Ukrainian troops northwest of Severodonetsk.\" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said her country \"does not send money to terrorist organizations,\" responding to claims from Turkey as the Nordic nation seeks to join NATO.  Speaking during a news conference in Stockholm on Wednesday, Andersson said dialogue between Turkey and Sweden was \"ongoing\" as part of efforts to counter Turkish concerns about Sweden joining the military alliance.   Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would \"say no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO,\" accusing both countries of housing Kurdish \"terror organizations.\"  On Wednesday, Andersson said during discussions that the Turkish and Swedish sides \"will naturally go through and discuss the list and sort out a number of things that have been unclear in reporting in the media and statements from other places.\" \"Clearly, it's about where we send our financial aid, for example, and that we sell weapons. We don't send money to terrorist organizations, obviously — or weapons either,\" Andersson continued.  European Council chief Charles Michel, who addressed journalists alongside Andersson, said although he didn't "want to make any statement" that would make things more difficult, he did want to express the EU's support for the "important step" Sweden and Finland have decided to take in applying for NATO membership.  European Council chief Charles Michel is \"confident\" that any issues over a proposed ban on Russian oil imports will be resolved by the next council meeting on May 30.  Addressing a news conference alongside the Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm on Wednesday, Michel said that although he was \"still confident\" that the bloc will be able to resolve any issues, it will require \"a lot of dialogue.\"  \"We are working very hard in order to be able to stay united,\" Michel stressed.  The Swedish prime minister publicly declared the country's desire \"to go further\" with sanctions against Russia.  The proposed ban has been largely opposed by Hungary, which has said that such a measure would be \"against Hungarian national energy security.\"  Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree on Wednesday making it easier for Ukrainians in the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions occupied by Russian troops to obtain Russian citizenship.  According to the decree published on a government portal, amendments will be made to an existing decree used to simplify the process for the residents of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic or the Luhansk People's Republic.  Russia handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to residents of the DPR and LPR ahead of the massive Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, helping create one of the pretexts for a wider war. The Ukrainian presidential administration on Wednesday reported \"fierce battles\" around the industrial city of Severodonetsk in the eastern Luhansk region, with a top military official saying shelling of the town had increased \"exponentially.\"  A statement on Wednesday from the presidential administration reported \"fierce battles for Severodonetsk,\" with constant mortar shelling, adding, \"In the morning, with the support of artillery, the Russian occupiers are advancing on Severodonetsk.\" According to the statement, six civilians have died and eight were wounded in the region amid the stepped-up fighting.  Serhiy Haidai, the head of the Luhansk region military administration, said the shelling of Severodonetsk had \"increased exponentially\" in recent hours.  \"Russian troops are very close; they can already fire mortars,\" he said. \"The fighting was on the outskirts of the city yesterday. [Russian] forces are being transferred here from different regions — from Kharkiv, Mariupol, even from Donetsk in order to push through in the Luhansk region at any cost.\" He added that \"the next week is important; if they do not succeed by Saturday or Sunday, they will run out of steam, and the situation will at least stabilize for us.\" Elsewhere in Ukraine, the Russian military acknowledged Wednesday that it had launched cruise missiles at targets in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia. A statement by Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian defense ministry spokesperson, said the strikes on Zaporizhzhia had targeted production workshops of the Motor Sich plant, an aerospace facility.  Ukrainian officials previously reported strikes in Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk without giving extensive details on the facilities targeted. Officials in Zaporizhzhia subsequently posted video showing damage to a shopping mall.  The World Economic Forum opens. Fighting rages in Ukraine's east. And a state of emergency is declared in Hungary. Here's the latest on Russia's war in Ukraine: Dire warnings in Davos: Business and political leaders are descending on the Swiss ski resort town for the WEF, with the war in Ukraine one of the main points of conversation. Two of the early speakers addressed the conflict with stark predictions. Slovakia's Prime Minister warned his country would be next if Ukraine fell, while Hungarian-born billionaire and philanthropist George Soros said the invasion may have marked the start of \"a third world war.\"\n'His bubble of this alternative reality': Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking via videoconference at a breakfast event in Davos, said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin needs to \"leave his bubble of this alternative reality into the real world and talk to us, understand that a lot of people are being killed, including civilians.\" Zelensky said he was willing to talk to Putin, but directly, \"with no intermediaries, no brokers."\nHungary emergency: Hungary will enter a \"state of emergency\" due to the war in Ukraine, the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban said. The ruling will allow Orban to continue to rule by decree. Hungary was already in a state of emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic but that was set to expire at the end of May \nFood exports blocked: Russia has established an \"effective blockade\" in the northern third of the Black Sea, according to a US official who provided a declassified map of the region to CNN on the condition of anonymity. Ukraine provides about 10% of the world's wheat exports, the official noted — the vast majority of which exit the country from Black Sea ports. The head of the UN's World Food Programme has urged Putin to reopen ports in Ukraine to exports to prevent children around the world from starving.\nMariupol death toll: At least 22,000 residents are believed to have died during Russia's three-month assault on Mariupol, according to an official from the Ukrainian port city. Petro Andriushchenko said the figure is based on the many contacts he and other town hall officials continue to have with officials trapped inside, and believes the true number could be much higher. The figures cannot be independently verified. ##Catch Up## The Ukrainian folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra, which recently won the Eurovision Song Contest, is auctioning off its trophy to raise funds for the Ukrainian army, the group announced on Instagram Wednesday.  Oleh Psiuk, the group's frontman, also offered to sell his signature pink bucket hat.  The group recently announced it would tour Europe to raise funds for Ukraine and its armed forces.  Kalush Orchestra won the competition on May 15 with the song \"Stefania,\" written about the frontman's mother. The band beat competition from main rivals the United Kingdom and Spain. The event marked the first major cultural event in which Ukrainians have taken part since Russia invaded in February, and many in the audience waved Ukraine's blue and yellow national flag during the evening. Ahead of the final round, Kalush Orchestra were runaway favorites to win the campy, much-loved singing contest this year, in part because of all the obstacles it overcame due to the war. The band was unveiled as the country's entry on February 22, two days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Hungary's reelected Prime Minister Viktor Orban will continue to rule by decree after a state of emergency was declared at midnight due to the fact that one of the country's neighbors -- Ukraine -- is in a state of war.  "We have seen that the war and sanctions from Brussels have brought about a great economic upheaval and drastic price rises. The world is on the brink of an economic crisis. Hungary has to stay out of this war and has to protect the financial security of families,\" Orban said. The Hungarian government argues that "the government needs to be able to make decisions and act swiftly. The state of emergency, similarly to that introduced during the pandemic, will make it possible for the government to react quickly.\" Orban said the decree was reinstated to use "all methods at its disposal" to protect Hungary and Hungarians. The current state of emergency, which allows Orban to disable some laws and push through emergency measures by decree, was set to expire at the end of May. It had been introduced in the spring of 2020 at the start of the coronavirus-pandemic. Orban and his Fidesz party were reelected in April despite his historically pro-Kremlin positions and close relationship with Putin. The war there upended the contest, which had been focused mostly on domestic issues before the invasion began on February 24.  Orban's relationship with Kyiv has deteriorated over the years. He has impeded the country's attempts to form closer relations with NATO, and has clashed with successive governments in Kyiv. The Slovakian Prime Minister issued a stark warning about the future of his country should Russia defeat Ukraine during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday.  "If Ukraine fails, Slovakia is next,\" Prime Minister Eduard Heger told other EU and business leaders. \n\"They (Ukraine) have to win," he said.  Heger went on to criticize members of the European Union for relying too heavily on Russian energy. He urged leaders to "stop compromising" their principles when dealing with Russia.  "We basically traded our values for cheap gas and oil for too long,\" he said. \"Compromising with Putin caused a war in Ukraine. An aggressive war, people are dying." \nUkrainians are "shedding their own blood for our values, so we don't have to," Heger said.  Entry into the Union: Heger asked the bloc to work with Ukraine and the western Balkans to come up with \"standardized rules so they can accede to the EU.\" Ukraine has, in recent years, deepened its economic and political ties with the EU, and Kyiv has expressed a desire to join. Nations in the western Balkans have also sought accession for several years.  Joining the bloc usually takes several years, as nations must satisfy strict criteria for membership before engaging in negotiations. However, some current EU leaders have rebuffed the idea that its membership could be fast-tracked due to the invasion.  "There's no such thing as a fast-tracking of accession, such a thing doesn't exist,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in March. Lithuania will transfer a new shipment of aid to Ukraine \"to further support its defence against Russia,\" the Lithuanian ministry of defense said Wednesday. On Twitter, Arvydas Anusauskas said the Baltic nation will send 20 M113 armored vehicles, 10 military trucks and 10 SUVs for demining operations. \"Our support is crucial for Ukraine's victory and defence of its sovereignty,\" he said, adding that \"Lithuania provided the first assistance before the war started and now we are constantly thinking about additional effective support that is critical to Ukraine going forward.\"  Some context: Lithuania has been a strong supporter of Ukraine since the start of the war in February, becoming the first European Union country to stop Russian gas imports. Earlier this month, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said the Russian regime had to be removed to stop \"warmongering.\" Read more here: Correction: This article has been updated with a correct photo of Arvydas Anusauskas, who was incorrectly identified by Associated Press in a previously published photo. Oleksandr Honcharenko, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, urged residents Wednesday not to return following a Russian airstrike overnight.  \"An anxious night in Kramatorsk,\" he wrote in a statement on Facebook. \"An air strike on residential areas and the private sector. No casualties. Friends, I understand how hard it is for you outside your hometown. But the enemy is getting closer. The danger is not somewhere out there, but here - nearby! It's too early to go back, no matter how hard it is for you.\" Kramatorsk saw a deadly missile strike on a railway station in early April, killing at least 50 civilians, including five children, who were evacuating the fighting in the country's east. Read more here: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that he can only talk with Vladimir Putin once the Russian President returns to the \"real world.\" "Once the President is prepared to leave his bubble of this alternative reality into the real world and talk to us, understand that a lot of people are being killed, including civilians, perhaps then, will he understand that we should start talking and should put the end to this war that he launched, his country is waging against us," Zelensky said via videoconference at a breakfast event moderated by Fareed Zakaria in Davos.  This is not the first time world leaders have accused Putin of being out of touch with reality when it comes to his motives for the war in Ukraine.  Putin said the Kremlin's invasion began to protect Russian speakers from genocide at the hands of \"neo-Nazis,\" despite the lack of any concrete evidence. While Ukraine does have a far-right battalion playing a role in the resistance, Putin has exploited the fighting forces' neo-Nazi ties as a pretext for the war. Shortly after the invasion began, he referred to the country's leaders in Kyiv as a \"gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,\" despite the fact that Zelensky is Jewish. US intelligence assessed in March that Putin's advisers were not properly informing him about the status of the war, including Russia's early failures on the battlefield. Speaking to Zakaria on Wednesday, Zelensky said he could only talk with Putin directly, \"with no intermediaries, no brokers." The Ukrainian President also said Russia should withdraw its troops and equipment as the first step in negotiations between the two countries and that Ukraine will fight until \"it regains all its territory back.\" The event was hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a Ukrainian charity founded in 2006, and the investment advisory group EastOne.  British retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced it will \"fully exit\" the Russian in light of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.  \"M&S is a values-led business; therefore, as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, we ceased shipments to Russia on 3 March 2022,\" the company said in a yearly results report published Wednesday. \n\"Subsequently, we have made the decision to fully exit our Russian franchise and we have recognised a charge of £31 million ($38 million) in adjusting items, representing our full exit costs from Russia and business disruption in Ukraine.\" Some context: M&S is the latest in a growing line of businesses that have abandoned or scaled back operations in Russia since it began its invasion of Ukraine.  On Monday, Starbucks said it had \"made the decision to exit and no longer have a brand presence in the market\" after having previously paused its operations and stopped shipments of its products to Russia.  Last week, McDonald's said it was selling its Russia business after operating for more than 30 years in the region.  The burger chain said the \"humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald's to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald's values.\" The British government has approved the sale of Chelsea Football Club, saying Russian owner Roman Abramovich will not benefit from the $5 billion deal .  \"Last night the Government issued a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea FC,\" Britain's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, tweeted Wednesday. \"Given the sanctions we placed on those linked to Putin and the bloody invasion of Ukraine, the long-term future of the club can only be secured under a new owner.\"\n\"We are satisfied the proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or other sanctioned individuals,\" she added.  On Tuesday, the English Premier League said its board had approved the sale of the club to a group led by American businessman Todd Boehly. A UK government spokesperson said they will be \"ensuring the proceeds of the sale are used for humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war.\" "The steps today will secure the future of this important cultural asset and protect fans and the wider football community,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have been in discussions with relevant international partners for necessary licences required and we thank them for all their cooperation." Some context: The sale of Chelsea brings an end to nearly two decades of Abramovich's ownership of the club. The Russian oligarch has known ties to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin and was sanctioned by the UK shortly after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.  Ukrainian officials reported Russian missile attacks on the east-central Dnipropetrovsk region and southeastern Zaporizhzhia region on Wednesday, causing extensive damage in the city of Zaporizhzhia.  The Russian military launched four cruise missiles on Zaporizhzhia Wednesday, a statement from the Zaporizhzhia Regional Council said. One missile was shot down by the city's air defense, it added.  In an update, the council added at least one person was killed and three others injured, and that 62 buildings were damaged in residential areas of the city. In a separate statement Wednesday, Valentyn Reznichenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said there had been constant air raid alarms overnight.  \"The enemy fired three missiles at Kryvyi Rih this morning,\" Reznichenko said. \"An industrial enterprise was hit. There is severe destruction. We are clarifying the information on the victims.\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has effectively halted all maritime trade at Ukrainian ports, according to declassified US intelligence, blocking grain exports and risking a global food crisis. Here's the latest on Russia's war in Ukraine: Food exports blocked: Russia has established an \"effective blockade\" in the northern third of the Black Sea, according to a US official who provided a declassified map of the region to CNN on the condition of anonymity. Ukraine provides about 10% of the world's wheat exports, the official noted — the vast majority of which exit the country from Black Sea ports. The head of the UN's World Food Programme has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to reopen ports in Ukraine to exports to prevent children around the world from starving.\nMariupol death toll: At least 22,000 residents are believed to have died during Russia's three-month assault on Mariupol, according to an official from the Ukrainian port city. Petro Andriushchenko said the figure is based on the many contacts he and other town hall officials continue to have with officials trapped inside, and believes the true number could be much higher. The figures cannot be independently verified.\nUkrainian forces withdraw from contested town: Russian forces have taken the contested town of Svitlodarsk in the eastern Donbas region, and Ukrainian forces have withdrawn, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said Tuesday. About 10,000 civilians remain in occupied Svitlodarsk, according to Kyrylenko. He added it was "not a retreat" of the Ukrainian forces, but a "regrouping" and the "right and logical decision" to save lives.\nUkraine shows drone footage: The Ukrainian military has for the first time released footage of special forces using small, foreign-made drones to target Russian positions. The portable, so-called kamikaze drones carry warheads and detonate on impact.\nEurope on alert: Hungary will enter a \"state of emergency\" due to the war in Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Tuesday. \"Hungary must stay out of this war and protect families' financial security. To do this, we need room for maneuver and the ability to act immediately,\" he said. Meanwhile, Poland's foreign minister said Russia would remain a threat to peace in Europe even after any ceasefire in Ukraine. ##Catch Up## Russia's invasion of Ukraine has effectively halted all maritime trade at Ukrainian ports, according to newly declassified US intelligence, cutting off a critical export commodity for Ukraine and risking a global food crisis. In the months since Russia moved to invade in February, it has established an "effective blockade" in the northern third of the Black Sea, according to a US official who provided a declassified map of the region to CNN on the condition of anonymity.  The map analyzes the density of ships coming in and out of Ukrainian ports before and after the start of the conflict, showing an almost total drop-off of commercial traffic to ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov after the start of the invasion. A third map provides a current visualization of the density of Russian naval vessels clustered in the Black Sea off Ukraine's coast, highlighting "hotbeds of activity," according to the US official.  "The impact of Russia's actions cannot be understated as Ukraine's seaborne exports are vital to global food security," the US official said, echoing the broad assessment of Western analysts and government officials.  Ukraine provides about 10% of the world's wheat exports, the official noted, the vast majority of which exit the country from Black Sea ports.  Some context: Before the war, Ukraine was the world's fourth-largest exporter of corn and fifth-largest exporter of wheat, according to the US State Department. Almost 30% of global trade in wheat came from Russia and Ukraine alone.  The United Nations World Food Program — which helps combat global food insecurity — buys about half of its wheat from Ukraine each year and has warned of dire consequences if Ukrainian ports are not opened up. Last week CNN reported that the US and allies are holding discussions on how to safely develop routes to transport grain from Ukraine amid concerns about global food supplies. New satellite images reported by CNN on Monday appear to substantiate Ukrainian claims that Russia is also stealing stores of grain that have been sitting idle at commercial ports.  Since the start of the conflict, Russia has intimidated commercial traffic, occasionally impeded safe passage to Ukraine through the Kerch Strait and, most visibly, stationed warships off Ukraine's coast and pummeled Ukrainian ports, the US official said.  CNN's Alex Marquardt contributed to this post "Mariupol is now a city of ghosts," an adviser to the mayor of the ruined Ukrainian port city said Tuesday.   Speaking to CNN's Melissa Bell, Petro Andriushchenko — who has fled to Ukrainian-held territory — said Mariupol town hall officials believe at least 22,000 residents of the city were killed during three months of war — a figure that cannot be independently verified, with the free press now unable to access the city and those still inside too scared to speak openly. The figure of 22,000 is based, Andriushchenko said, on the many contacts he and other town hall officials continue to have with officials trapped inside. But he believes the actual figure could be much higher. Andriushchenko said the process of reburying the dead has been complicated by Russian official insistence that reclaimed bodies be brought to a morgue and that a person claiming a body must agree to record a video in which the applicant says the deceased was killed by the Ukrainian military.  Based on the information gathered from his network of sources, Mariupol has been thrown back to the Middle Ages, Andriushchenko said. "It is absolutely dark inside the city. The only lights are from Russian troops and Russian patrols," he said. "Everywhere it's the smell of death and the smell of fire." The mayor's adviser said his contacts paint a picture of a city in the grips of a humanitarian catastrophe with very little contact to the outside world. Mobile phone connections are only just beginning to be re-established. He said residents are unable to move freely, with special passes needed for any movement within the city and a filtration system keeping them from fleeing altogether. Mariupol has been at the center of a ferocious, months-long battle between Ukrainian government forces and Russian soldiers and pro-Russian fighters.  It officially fell to Russian forces Friday when the last group of the Azovstal fighters at the steel plant they had been holding out in for several weeks surrendered. Russian forces have taken the contested town of Svitlodarsk in the eastern Donbas region and Ukrainian forces have withdrawn, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration. \"About 10,000 civilians remain in occupied Svitlodarsk,\" Kyrylenko said Tuesday. \"No more than 30% of the population left the city. Today, May 24, the Russian army entered Svitlodarsk in the Donetsk region. Russian flags have already been hoisted there.\" According to Kyrylenko, Svitlodarsk had been surrounded on three sides, and the city had not been under intense shelling, so much of the civilian population remained.   \"This is not a retreat [of the Armed Forces of Ukraine], but a regrouping,\" he said. \"This is the right and logical decision in this situation to save the lives of [the military] and regroup.\" Pro-Russian Telegram channels showed images of the Russian flag being hoisted over the city administration building in Svitlodarsk. Kyrylenko also described the situation as \"very difficult\" in Lyman, a city further north in Donetsk region. \"The situation there is now one of the tensest along the entire front line,\" he said. A Ukrainian official from the Russian-controlled port city of Mariupol claimed 200 bodies had been discovered in the rubble of a ruined high-rise building, another gruesome find in the city that has been devastated by months of Russian bombardment.  Petro Andriushenko, adviser to Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko, said in a statement on Telegram Tuesday that around 200 bodies were found during the dismantling of the rubble of a high-rise building near a suburban gas station. The bodies were found in a basement underneath the wrecked building in an advanced state of decomposition, he added. \"Due to the refusal of locals to collect and pack up the bodies of the dead, the Russian Ministry of Emergencies left the site,\" Andriushchenko said. \"The bodies of the dead remained in place. The stench can be smelled almost throughout the quarter due to partially dismantled debris.\" CNN was not able to immediately verify Andriushchenko's claim. Andriushchenko is not in Mariupol but has served as a clearinghouse for information from residents remaining in the city.  Ukrainian officials say more than 20,000 residents of the city died during three months of war — a figure that cannot be independently supported — and many of the dead have been hastily buried in courtyards.  Andriushchenko said the process of reburying the dead has been complicated by Russian officials' insistence that reclaimed bodies be brought to a morgue and that a person claiming a body must agree to record a video in which the applicant says the deceased was killed by the Ukrainian military.  \"The city has turned into a continuous cemetery,\" Andriushchenko said.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have marked the start of \"a third world war,\" and Russian President Vladimir Putin must be defeated \"as soon as possible\" if the world wants to preserve civilization. That was the stark message that Hungarian-born billionaire and philanthropist George Soros delivered on Tuesday to attendees at the 2022 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Even when the fighting stops, as it eventually must, the situation will never revert\" to where it was before, warned the 91-year-old Soros.\n\"Other issues that concern all of humanity — fighting pandemics and climate change, avoiding nuclear war, maintaining global institutions — have had to take a back seat to that struggle. That's why I say civilization may not survive.\" The former hedge fund manager, who is chair of Soros Fund Management LLC and founder of the Open Society Foundations, is famous for using his wealth to help foster open societies and create inclusive democracies with governments that are held accountable. But after the events of September 11, he noted, the tide began to turn against open societies. As a result, \"repressive regimes are now in the ascendance and open societies are under siege,\" he said Tuesday. \"Today, China and Russia present the greatest threat to open society.\" Read more: The Ukrainian military has for the first time released footage of special forces using foreign-made kamikaze drones targeting Russian positions. According to the Ukrainian military, the drone was equipped with a powerful explosive that caused damage to a Russian tank after it flew into it.  \"The combat use of kamikaze UAVs is a constant practice for SOF of Ukraine in the war with Russian invaders,\" the Ukrainian military said. \"This is a good example of how the help of foreign partners together with the training and professionalism of our soldiers give positive results at the front.\" The US sent 100 Switchblade drones to the Ukrainian military in April. The small, portable, so-called kamikaze drones carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to 6 miles (about 10 kilometers) away, according to a company that produces the drones. Watch:"

    "body": "The summer Tim Thomas was 18, he packed up a rucksack, left his small hometown in the south of England and hopped on a train to France, kicking off a month-long journey through Europe by rail. It was 1972. Thomas was among the first travelers to take advantage of the fledgling European Interrail pass, which allowed young people under 21, across 21 participating countries, to buy a £27.50 (at the time about $67) ticket for unlimited travel across Europe by train for a full month. \"It was a bit ideal really, you were young and fit and every day there'd be a new country or town or whatever in front of you to explore,\" Thomas tells CNN Travel. \"There was always something to look forward to.\" The Interrail pass was dreamed up by the International Union of Railways (UIC), a body overseeing Europe's railways that's since ceded control of Interrail to the independent Eurail company.  The UIC emerged in 1922 after Europe's borders were rearranged following World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles. In 1972, the organization envisaged the cross-Europe travel pass as a fun way to celebrate its 50th birthday and to encourage rail travel among European youth. A similar scheme, the Eurail pass, already existed for international travelers -- why not open the continent's trains up to young Europeans? \"There was no high speed rail, there were no low cost flights, there were less coaches -- and overall travel was on a totally different level than today,\" Alexander Mokros, chairman of Eurail, tells CNN Travel.  \"People were traveling much less. So they had this great idea to launch a special product specially for youths, so everybody, until the age of 21, could discover the continent.\" It wasn't just travel that was different in 1972. The map of Europe looked different, too. The first iteration of the Interrail pass focused on north, west and southern Europe, with eastern Europe largely blocked off behind the Iron Curtain. Brightly colored posters were plastered across Europe's railway stations and word spread about the UIC's rail offering. Young people discussed plans and sketched out routes. Thomas reckons Interrail first arrived on his radar via a poster.  \"I've always enjoyed train travel, and so I went with a friend who I'd been at school with,\" he says. Still, Thomas' trip was nearly over before it began: as his train set off down the English coast towards the gateway port of Dover, Thomas realized he had left his bag in the waiting room at Ashford station, a stop on the line between London and Dover. Today, a bag abandoned in a railway station is liable to be removed and destroyed. In 1972, Thomas explained the dilemma to train staff who told him not to worry -- they would pass on the message through their network, and the bag would be sent up on the next train and they could do a handover at Dover. \"Sure enough, I just had to wait on the platform, and the next train came along and the driver handed it out of his cab to me,\" recalls Thomas.  \"From then on, I believe, we managed to avoid making too many mistakes like that.\" Thomas and his friend journeyed around Europe in what he describes as a \"figure of eight\" route. They headed first to southwest France, then across to Switzerland, up to Denmark, then down to Athens in Greece via Yugoslavia and Munich, Germany. \"We got our full month's worth, and I've kept all the itineraries with the detail of the individual trains and the distances involved,\" says Thomas.  The travelers relied on the Thomas Cook Continental Timetable, a bible for European train travelers that details all the train times and the distance in miles between stations. (The guide is still published under the name \"European Rail Timetable.\") And in this pre-euro, pre-online banking world, if the travelers wanted to exchange currencies, they had to line up at the bank, passports in hand.  They saved money by sleeping on the train wherever possible. Otherwise, they'd bunk down for the night in hostels. Thomas reckons they were lucky that, as 18-year-olds exploring their first taste of independence, the biggest obstacle they faced en route was sunburn. They enjoyed pretty much every day of the trip. \"It's a kind of freedom isn't it, when you're away from home?\" says Thomas.  Martin McKee, who grew up in Northern Ireland, set out on his inaugural Interrail trip in 1972. Only 15, he traveled with three friends from school. Over the course of the month, the group occasionally split ways, but reconvened at various points along the journey. Exploring Europe at a formative age had a significant effect on McKee's way of thinking. A year or so after the trip, he interviewed at the University of Newcastle in England, where he hoped to study medicine. Amid the ongoing context of the sectarian violence in Ireland known as \"the Troubles,\" the interviewers asked McKee if he considered himself British or Irish. Teenage McKee replied that he was European. \"The people that were traveling, who were my age or older, and who had that sort of curiosity and wanted to see the world, we all had much, much more in common than the communities that we came from,\" he tells CNN Travel. Today, McKee is a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and in 2020 he became a member of the World Health Organization convened Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development. All in all, 87,000 young people traveled via the EU Interrail pass in 1972, according to Eurail. Such numbers meant that for the UIC, continuing the scheme beyond that inaugural year was a no-brainer. Thomas went Interrailing again in 1973 and 1974. On all three trips, his Hanimex Compact R camera came with him. The device's small size made it pretty easy to transport. Snapping photos of the length and breadth of Europe, Thomas tried to avoid getting people in his photos. But today, looking through his slides, he enjoys the ones with photobombing strangers more than the emptier scenes -- they offer a taste of life in Europe at the time, 1970s bell bottom jeans and all. Interrailing through the 1970s As the 1970s progressed, \"Interrail\" became a verb, a staple of European travel vernacular. Trudy Harpham, emeritus professor at London South Bank University, went Interrailing on three consecutive college summer vacations. \"As a student, the cheap deal of Interrail for a month in the summer was pretty irresistible,\" she tells CNN Travel. \"I wanted to go as far as the scheme would allow me.\" On the first trip, in 1975, Harpham and her then boyfriend packed up their backpacks and a two-person tent and snaked across Europe by rail, reaching Istanbul in Turkey. \"I was stepping into the unknown,\" Harpham recalls, but she found a friendly and convivial atmosphere among the Interrailing community.  \"It felt so sociable and communal and exciting,\" she says. As the trains chugged across the continent, Harpham jotted down her observations on countries and their cultures in dispatches back home to England. \"Almost in every new country that I crossed into, I wrote a postcard to my parents in Lincolnshire, who were delighted to receive them,\" says Harpham.  Harpham's mother kept all the postcards, telling her daughter that one day she would appreciate being able to look back on her adventures. Of course it wasn't all exciting. Long periods on trains could be tedious. On Harpham's 1973 trip, which included traveling up to the Arctic Circle in Norway, she recalls thinking that she \"didn't want to see another birch tree forest in my life after that.\" But most of the time, Harpham relished the experience of waking up in a new place after a night of travel. \"If we were lucky enough to have a seat, pushing that old fashioned blind up the window and peering out and wondering where you were was just magical,\" she recalls. Today, British-born Harpham lives in Switzerland. She's retired, but worked in international public health and lived in over 50 countries.  Harpham recalls returning from her summers Interailing and feeling like she was in a club made up of young people from across Europe. \"Only the others who did it really understood the feeling of liberation and excitement and sheer exposure, wonderful opportunities to see so many places in a relatively short time, and relatively low cost,\" she says. Interrail today In 2022, the European Interrail pass turns 50. It has morphed and developed over the years, but the fundamental concept remains unchanged -- a relatively simple railway gateway to Europe. The biggest difference between the scheme today and its early years is it's now open to everyone, of all ages. Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of popular train website The Man in Seat 61, says this change was \"the best thing that's happened\" to the pass in its five decades of existence. Today, there's also a greater range of Interrailing options. Travelers can choose based on number of travel days and class of ticket. Europe's railways have changed too. High speed services are now more commonplace and, until recently, night trains were on the out but the tide there appears to be turning again thanks to a recent resurgence of sleeper services across Europe. Smith also suggests the continent's trains are now more fragmented, with some long distance routes now broken up into smaller sections. And while Smith's own website is a treasure trove of Interrailing tips and tricks, he tells CNN Travel he's an advocate for packing the 2022 version of the Thomas Cook timetable, now called the European Rail timetable. Scouring the internet on your phone can't beat pouring over the timetable and manually planning out your route, suggests Smith, especially with the ever-changing European landscapes speeding past the window. Today, 33 countries participate in the Interrail scheme and the pass is available in digital form. Prices start at €185 (around $198) for under 27s traveling four days within one month. The Eurail pass, the version for international travelers, also still exists. Prices are identical to Interrail, also starting at €185 (around $198) for under 27s traveling four days within one month. Times have changed, but Mokros, from the Eurail team, suggests the appeal of Interrailing is more or less the same as it was for the inaugural 1970s travelers, and ticket holders today enjoy being part of a long line of Interrailers past and present. \"Even if you're traveling alone, you're not traveling alone, you're traveling somehow with others, you're crossing with others, you're making stories you can talk about without others,\" says Mokros. The continent-spanning pass also represents a sense of European unity, which has an added resonance in a post-Brexit, post-Covid Europe grappling with the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The pass also turns 50 in a moment when growing numbers of travelers are keen to make more sustainable choices, mov",

    "body": "In the peak of 2020 lockdowns, giant oil companies had a wake-up call. Demand had cratered, sapping profits, and it wasn't clear when it would end. That gave environmentally minded investors an in. The pitch: Get on the clean and green path or perish. Fossil fuel companies, especially in Europe, responded to pressure from shareholders, customers, activists and governments with bold plans to invest in clean energy. Wall Street, for its part, said it would start holding these companies to account for their pledges on the climate. But half way through 2022, as fossil fuel prices surge and restore oil giants to their pre-pandemic profitability, the push toward green reform appears to have taken a back seat. Exxon shares are up 54% this year. Shell is up nearly 44%. BP, which took a huge loss on its Russia business, is up more than 28%. Much of that is thanks to record profits and soaring energy prices. It's little surprise, then, that their report cards on the environment look abysmal.  Despite their pledges, major oil companies \"still fail to meet the bare minimum for alignment with the Paris Agreement,\" wrote researchers for Oil Change International, an anti-fossil-fuel advocacy group, in a report released Wednesday. Eight of the major oil producers' plans are \"grossly insufficient,\" they wrote. Outrage is boiling over. But whether shareholders feel the same pressure, when the times are this good, is another question.  See here: On Tuesday, Shell's annual shareholder meeting in London was delayed by nearly three hours as protesters chanted \"We will stop you,\" (to the tune of Queen's \"We Will Rock You.\") A day earlier, one of Shell's safety consultants quit, posting on LinkedIn that she \"can no longer work for a company that ignores all the alarms and dismisses the risks of climate change and ecological collapse.\" A representative for Shell didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Another protest on Wednesday targeted Total's shareholder meeting in Paris.  Despite the disruptions, the meetings carried on. A whopping 80% of shareholders approved Shell's climate resolution. An independent resolution from a group of climate activist shareholders garnered just 20% support, down from 30% last year, Reuters reported. Total secured 89% support on its climate plans, a spokesperson said.  Look ahead: Pressure is coming from other quarters, too. The United Kingdom is widely expected to announce a windfall tax that would redirect billions in profit from Shell and BP, among others, to help ease households' energy bills. While talk of the one-off tax shook British energy stocks on Tuesday, most were trading higher Wednesday in London.   Meanwhile, several officials at Davos, including US climate envoy John Kerry, have warned the business community not to let the disruptions from the war in Ukraine become an excuse to lean on fossil fuels as they scramble to meet demand.  Davos Dispatch  Here's Julia Horowitz, the lead writer of Before the Bell, with a dispatch from Davos, Switzerland, where she's reporting on the World Economic Forum. This morning, I sat down with Neil Murray, the CEO of Work Dynamics at JLL, the commercial real estate giant. Murray flew from Chicago to attend the forum. It's his third time here. He conceded that this time around, emotions are darker. \"The general feeling is quite muted,\" Murray told me. \"It's the confluence of challenges that we're faced with, whether it's the war a thousand kilometers away, inflation, climate, food and a falling stock market. I probably feel an air of less excitement, more concern.\" Market turbulence has beaten down JLL's shares this year. Its stock is down almost 31% after skyrocketing 82% in 2021. Real estate is often viewed as a hedge against inflation. But rising borrowing costs have made companies and investors more tentative about signing new deals. One trend in JLL's favor is that people are going back to their offices, though the pace of return varies by city and industry. The number of people in offices in the United States was at 43% in recent weeks, up from 25% in January when Omicron was surging, according to the firm's research. That figure is expected to rise to 55% in July. \"People are steadily coming back,\" Murray said, though he acknowledged something does need to be done to overcome the \"inertia\" of recent years. Many JLL clients are spending more on renovations with this in mind, Murray added. Yoga studios and wellness spaces have become the perks \"du jour.\" \"We have to make space commute-worthy,\" he said. Vacancies persist in big cities. Yet increasingly, the industry is seeing a \"flight to quality.\" Top tenants are favoring certain buildings that are more sustainable and have better amenities. Could this create a divide, as less money flows to neighborhoods and buildings that are seen as less desirable? Murray said there's \"always demand for space.\" He's hopeful that as flows of money shift, it could open up new opportunities for smaller companies to move in. Travel's hot summer is looking a bit tepid This third summer of the Covid era was supposed to be a boom time for travelers and for the industries that cater to them. It may be over before it even gets going, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica writes. At least, that's the story of travel stocks so far. Shares of major hotel chains, including Hilton, Wyndham and Hyatt are all down nearly 20% this year. Casino stocks Las Vegas Sands, MGM and Wynn Resorts also have plunged. Ditto cruise operators Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line. Airlines, which have held up better than the broader market this year, have been losing altitude lately. Shares of American, United, Delta and Southwest all fell sharply Tuesday and are now in the red for 2022. Airbnb is trading near an all-time low, more than 50% below its IPO price from late 2020. Vrbo owner Expedia has lost more than a third of its value in 2022. It's still early, of course. Last year, leisure companies' second and third quarter earnings were strong as consumers threw Covid caution to the wind. Travel companies may be facing difficult comparisons to last year's results. And inflation's certainly not doing them any favors. The \"revenge spending\" that spurred consumer demand last year is getting tempered this year by relentless sticker shock, according to analysts. Labor shortages are compounding those headaches. Despite all of that, CEOs are still cautiously optimistic pent-up demand will make this summer a lucrative one.  Heck, inflation may not be so bad after all. As Norwegian Cruise Line's CEO said in an earnings call this month: \"Inflation is an ugly word, but ... there's a pretty side to it, which is pricing power.\"",

    "body": "India has decided to restrict the sale of sugar on international markets, just days after it banned wheat exports.  In a statement on Wednesday, the Indian government said it will limit sugar exports to 10 million tons for the marketing season that runs through September to keep prices in check. Sellers have also been asked to seek \"specific permission\" from authorities for any export of sugar between June 1 and October 31. India is the world's biggest producer of sugar and the second largest exporter behind Brazil. The government of Narendra Modi said it needed to take action to maintain sugar stocks in the country after \"unprecedented growth in exports\" last year and in the current season.  The move to limit exports comes at a time when annual retail inflation in Asia's third largest economy hit 7.8%, its highest level in nearly eight years, in April. It is also another sign of rising food protectionism around the world, as major producers curb agricultural exports, adding to the supply shock triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. Ukraine and Russia together account for about 30% of all wheat exports.  In the current marketing year, which runs from October 2021 to September 2022, Indian sugar mills have so far signed contracts for exports of about 9 million tons. In the previous 12-month period, the country shipped 7 million tons of the sweetener overseas, which was the highest amount in recent years, according to government data. White sugar futures were trading 1% higher at $556.50 per metric ton on Wednesday in London. They've gained 13% since the start of January and are about 26% higher than this time last year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a historic shock to commodity markets that will keep global prices high through the end of 2024, the World Bank said last month. Food prices are expected to soar by 22.9% this year, driven by a 40% rise in wheat prices, it added.  Earlier this week, Malaysia moved to restrict exports of chicken to its neighbors, saying \"the government's priority is our own people.\" And, just days earlier, India had banned wheat exports, as life-threatening heat waves stunt output and push local prices to record highs. The country is the world's second biggest producer of wheat after China, but it is not a major exporter of  the commodity. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, India's commerce minister Piyush Goyal said that \"our export regulation should not affect global markets.\" \"We continue to allow exports to vulnerable countries and neighbors,\" he added. Despite these reassurances, India's restrictions underscore the fragility of the global food situation. Global buyers were hoping that Indian wheat shipments would help fill the gap created by the war in Europe, which has hit vital shipments of agricultural exports. However, there was some good news last week. Indonesia said it would lift a ban on exports of palm oil, which was put in place in April. The Southeast Asian country is the world's top producer of the product, which is widely used as cooking oil and in many food items.",

    "body": "The UK government has approved the sale of Chelsea Football Club to an ownership group led by Todd Boehly in a deal worth more than $5 billion. The sale of Chelsea, which was previously owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, has also been approved by the English Premier League. Abramovich put the club up for sale in early March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying at the time it was \"in the best interest of the Club.\" \"Last night the Government issued a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea FC,\" the UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries tweeted on Wednesday.  \"Given the sanctions we placed on those linked to Putin and the bloody invasion of Ukraine, the long-term future of the club can only be secured under a new owner. \"We are satisfied the proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or other sanctioned individuals,\" she added. Boehly is now set to add Chelsea to the portfolio of sporting franchises he has invested in, including stakes in the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks. The sale will end Abramovich's almost two-decade tenure at the helm of the London club. The Russian businessman has known ties to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin and was sanctioned earlier this year after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. A spokesperson for the UK government said proceeds of the sale will be used for \"humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war.\" \"The steps today will secure the future of this important cultural asset and protect fans and the wider football community,\" the spokesperson added.  \"We have been in discussions with relevant international partners for necessary licences required and we thank them for all their cooperation.\" English Premier League approval Earlier on Tuesday, the English Premier League announced that its board had approved the sale of Chelsea FC. \"The Premier League Board has today approved the proposed takeover of Chelsea Football Club by the Todd Boehly/Clearlake Consortium,\" the league said in a statement. \"Chelsea FC will now work with the relevant Governments to secure the necessary licences to complete the takeover.\" Since Abramovich's assets were frozen as a result of government sanctions, the club has operated under restricted finances and according to a license issued by the UK government.  The Premier League statement noted Boehly had passed the board's \"Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test (OADT).\" The club said that of the total investment being made, 2.5 billion pounds ($3.08 billion) will be used to buy the shares in the club and this money would be deposited into a frozen UK bank account \"with the intention to donate 100% to charitable causes as confirmed by Roman Abramovich.\" UK government approval would be required for the proceeds to be transferred from the frozen UK bank account, the club added. It said the proposed new owners would also \"commit 1.75 billion pounds ($2.16 billion) in further investment for the benefit of the club.\" This would include investments in the club's stadium Stamford Bridge, its academy, the women's team and funding for the Chelsea Foundation charity. The announcement of the Boehly deal came with just over three weeks remaining on the club's current operating license, which expires on May 31.",

    "body": "US President Joe Biden's warning the US would defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression has made headlines around the world -- and put growing tensions between the small democratic island and its neighboring autocratic superpower back under the spotlight. Less than a decade ago, ties seemed to be on the mend as the two sides -- separated by a strait that is fewer than 80 miles (128 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point -- deepened economic, cultural and even political engagements. But today, relations are at their lowest point in decades -- raising fears of military escalation, even as experts caution that an imminent all-out war remains unlikely. In recent months, China's tacit support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only fueled speculations over Beijing's intentions with Taiwan, raising questions about how the world might react should China launch an attack. Though the White House quickly downplayed Biden's comments, no other country is as deeply intertwined in the dispute as the United States, which has a complicated history with both sides and has long trod a delicate middle path. China's authoritarian turn under leader Xi Jinping and plummeting relations with Washington have pulled Taiwan closer into the orbit of the US. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral.  Here's what you need to know about the island increasingly at the forefront of US-China clashes. First, a quick history Taiwan, which has long been inhabited by indigenous peoples, became part of the Chinese empire in the 17th century. It was then ceded to Japan in 1895 after Imperial China lost the First Sino-Japanese War.  The island remained a Japanese colony for half a century until the end of World War II. Following the allied defeat of Japan, China's ruling Nationalist government, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), took control of Taiwan. Not long after, the Nationalists -- which ruled the mainland under the Republic of China (ROC) banner following the fall of Imperial China -- came under renewed attack from an insurgent Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  The two sides entered into a bloody civil war that resulted in the eventual defeat of the Nationalists who fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of the ROC government from Nanjing to Taipei. Across the strait, the CCP took power and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing. Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory. In Taipei, the Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, dreamed of one day retaking the mainland; In Beijing, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong deemed Taiwan the last piece to a united \"new China\" -- a \"problem\" that needed to be solved sooner or later.  In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today  a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world, and has become increasingly isolated diplomatically. Over the years, an increasing number of governments have switched their diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, leaving Taiwan with only 15 diplomatic allies at the end of 2021. What's the US' role in all this? During the Chinese civil war, the United States backed the Nationalists, while the Communists had support from the Soviet Union. The US continued to support the KMT government after its retreat to Taiwan, providing it with development assistance to help build its economy, all the while shunning the PRC as an ideological and military adversary. But following a diplomatic conflict between Beijing and Moscow in the 1960s -- known as the Sino-Soviet split -- relations between the PRC and the US began to thaw to counterbalance the Soviet Union.  By 1979, the US joined a growing list of nations to formally switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In what is known as the \"One China\" policy, Washington recognizes the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the CCP's claim of sovereignty over the island.  Meanwhile, the US continues to retain close unofficial ties with Taiwan under the terms of the decades-old Taiwan Relations Act, facilitating commercial, cultural and other exchanges through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- the de facto US Embassy in Taipei. Washington has also been supplying the island with defensive weaponry, but it has remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend the island in case of a Chinese invasion -- a policy known as \"strategic ambiguity.\" This is meant to keep a lid on the showdown by deterring China by keeping open the possibility of a US military response. At the same time, it's aimed at depriving Taiwan of US assurances that could prompt it to declare official independence. The goal is to preserve the status quo and to avoid a war in Asia -- and it has worked, allowing Washington to walk the tightrope of relations with both sides. But under Biden, that \"strategic ambiguity\" has become somewhat less ambiguous. Since taking office, Biden has said on three occasions the US would be willing to intervene militarily should the Chinese attack -- though the White House has rushed to walk back his remarks each time. But his latest warning against Beijing carried extra symbolic weight -- it was made right on China's doorstep during his first trip to Asia as President, which is aimed at uniting allies and partners to counter China's rising influence. As expected, Beijing has reacted angrily to his remarks, expressing its \"strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition\" and accusing the US of \"playing with fire.\" Why are tensions increasing? For decades since the founding of the PRC, animosity reigned between Beijing and Taipei, with trade, travel and communication largely cut off. Military conflicts continued to flare up, with the PRC shelling several outlying islands controlled by the ROC on two separate occasions. But tensions began to ease in the late 1980s, allowing limited private visits, indirect trade and investment across the strait. The ties reached a peak in 2015 during a historic meeting between the heads of the KMT and CCP in Singapore. But relations deteriorated quickly after 2016, when Tsai Ing-wen from the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a landslide presidential election in Taiwan -- propelled by concerns among voters that Taiwan was moving too close to Beijing under the KMT government. And under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home. Its relentless crackdown on democracy and freedoms in Hong Kong has further alienated many people in Taiwan, who fear they could face the same fate were they to be under Beijing's rule. Tensions are running especially high as the Chinese military ramps up its pressure on the island, in response to what Beijing sees as \"provocations\" by the administrations in Taiwan and the US. How likely is conflict? After aggressive military displays from Beijing in 2021, Taiwan's Defense Minister warned that China would be able to mount a \"full-scale\" invasion of Taiwan by 2025 -- prompting discussions on potential armed conflict.  The Chinese military maneuvers and drills are a reminder to Taiwan and the US not to cross Beijing's red lines, said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. She said those red lines include campaigning for formal Taiwan independence or a decision to deploy large numbers of US troops to the island. In interview with CNN last year, President Tsai said the threat from Beijing was growing \"every day.\"  But on the streets of Taipei, the mood appears to be mostly relaxed and confident. And analysts agree that despite the rhetoric and the military saber-rattling, China is unlikely to invade Taiwan anytime soon.  US intelligence officials have also not yet seen anything to suggest that China is preparing a military offensive, according to people familiar with the assessments. On Monday, Biden also echoed such assessment. \"My expectation is it will not happen,\" he told reporters. \"It will not be attempted.\" Aiming for a peaceful resolution to the standoff across the Taiwan Strait makes sense -- experts have long said that any attempt by Beijing to forcefully take the island would be a hugely costly endeavor, with an uncertain outcome. Moreover, the swift and coordinated response from the US and its allies to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has likely alarmed Beijing, say experts, who suggest its leaders are watching Western reaction to Ukraine with Taiwan in mind. It remains to be seen what lessons Beijing would draw from the Ukraine crisis -- it could become more cautious in its calculation in light of Russia's floundering invasion and the strong Western response. But on the other hand, Beijing could also conclude that \"any attempt to take the island by force will only get harder the longer they wait, as Taiwan may get more serious about its defense and the US and its allies may get more serious about preparing with Taiwan for that fight,\" wrote Bill Bishop, an expert on Chinese politics and author of the Sinocism newsletter.",
